{"Title": "How Was Earth Formed?", "Article": "<img src=\"data/earth-formation.jpg\"><br>Our Earth was formed from the gas clouds & dust that remained after the Sun was formed around 4.6 billion years ago. <br>Some of the dust, pieces of rock and gas that were orbiting the Sun smashed against one another, and began to heat up, until the entire mass melted.<br>As the mass grew, it became large enough to develop a magnetic force or gravity. This force kept the materials from flying off again. It also attracted more materials until the area around became free of debris and the Earth took shape. Some materials in the mass that were heavier than others fell towards centre to become the core. The rest formed the mantle, crust and atmosphere.<br>In the beginning, our planet was a giant, red hot, boiling sea of molten rock. Gradually, the Earth began to cool, and a thin crust appeared on its surface. The core, however, remained red hot.<br>As the cooling progressed, water vapor was formed, and it escaped into the atmosphere. This water vapor condensed to form clouds. The clouds led to rain, and soon storms were raging over the planet, cooling the surface sill further, and causing floods. The floods led to the formation of the oceans and the seas."}
