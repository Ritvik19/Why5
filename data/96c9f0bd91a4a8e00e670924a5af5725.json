{"Title": "Why Do Ostriches Bury Their Heads In The Sand?", "Article": "<img src=\"data/ostrich.jpg\"><br>\n<b>Myth:</b><br>\nOstriches bury their heads in the sand when they're scared or threatened. <br>\n<b>How It Started:</b><br>\nIt's an optical illusion! Ostriches are the largest living birds, but their heads are pretty small. \"If you see them picking at the ground from a distance, it may look like their heads are buried in the ground,\" says Glinda Cunningham of the American Ostrich Association.<br>\n<b>Why It's Not True:</b><br>\nOstriches don't bury their heads in the sand\u2014they wouldn't be able to breathe! But they do dig holes in the dirt to use as nests for their eggs. Several times a day, a bird puts her head in the hole and turns the eggs. So it really does look like the birds are burying their heads in the sand!"}
