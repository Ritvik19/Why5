{"Title": "What Is Meant By 'Easter Egg'?", "Article": "In a software, developers leave traces for codes and comments that reveal information about a secret feature or a backdoor or small goody (something like a small graphic, a picture or any such content).<br>In a movie trailer, while we concentrate on the major action happening in the forefront, in the background there is a lot of detail that we generally miss out that could reveal a lot more about the movie, about the connections and also what is to be expected in the future parts (sequels etc).<br>In a similar way, a product advertisement may just give hints about the actual feature of a product but give enough hints about to find out. (not exactly Easter egg in true sense)<br>The term Easter egg is used because you won\u2019t find the detail that easily, it is hidden carefully revealing as little as possible and like the Easter festival, you got to go on a treasure hunt to find them."}
