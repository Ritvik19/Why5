{"Title": "Why are Deserts Dry?", "Article": "The main reason for this is that deserts get very little rainfall.<br>Deserts near the equator are dry. This is because I these places, instead of hot air rising and being replaced by cool moist air, air settles downwards, and becomes warmer and drier as it does so.<br>Deserts that are far away from the equator are generally dry, because of their distance from sea. This prevents moisture laden winds from reaching them. Sometimes there are mountains which act as barriers to the winds. These mountains will get rainfall on the side facing the sea, but the side facing land doesn\u2019t get any rain."}
