{"Title": "What Is Daylight Saving Time?", "Article": "<img src=\"data/daylight-saving.jpg\"><br><br>Daylight saving time is the practice of advancing clocks during warmer months so that darkness falls later each day according to the clock. The typical implementation of DST is to set clocks forward by one hour in the spring (\"spring forward\") and set clocks back by one hour in autumn (\"fall back\") to return to standard time. In other words, there is one 23-hour day in late winter or early spring and one 25-hour day in the autumn."}
