{"Title": "Why Are There Crushed Stones Alongside Railway Tracks?", "Article": "You can see small crushed stones in and around the railway track. These stones are known as <b>Ballast</b>. Even though ballast appears to be useless, it\u2019s not. Ballast helps to hold the tracks in place, as trains roll by. It also helps in draining out water from the track.<br>Sometimes plants grow into the track causing interference to the train movement, but ballast slows down this growth. It also bears the load from the rails. Thus, one can easily say that these are very useful."}
