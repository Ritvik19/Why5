It is a graphical operating system. It dominates the world\u2019s personal computer market with over 90% of market share overtaking its rival Mac OS. There have been different versions of Windows like Windows 98, XP, Vista, 7, 8 and most recent one is Windows 10. But one of the common options in all these is \u201cRefresh\u201d option which appears when you right-click the mouse.<br>Have you ever wondered \u2013 what really happens when you click on refresh?<br>Some non-techie people might think that it will improve your system performance or it will make your system run faster but this is absolutely wrong. When you hit the refresh button the memory of your system is reloaded with the up to date information. In simple words refresh will redraw everything present on the screen pixel by pixel and displays the latest data. Refresh option is not meant for speeding up the performance. Then the question arises when does refresh is useful?<br><br>Refresh is useful in the following cases:<br>1.\tWhen your data is not up to date.<br>2.\tWhen the desktop or other folders don\u2019t display the files you created, moved, copied or deleted.<br>3.\tWhen the realigned icons or files on the desktop or other folders don\u2019t show up.<br>4.\tWhen files created by 3rd party applications don\u2019t show in the folder.<br>5.\tWhen the name of a file is changed but it doesn\u2019t show the new name.<br>6.\tWhen you change any appearance settings. etc<br>In fact, by clicking the refresh button the system will take few extra microseconds to display the latest data and if you press it continuously the system will slow down a bit in order to read and write the cycles it has to perform inside the hard disk."}
