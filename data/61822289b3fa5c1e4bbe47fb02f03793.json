{"Title": "How Do Eagles Glide Without Flapping Their Wings?", "Article": "If you watch an eagle\u2019s movements through binoculars, you will see that even though the bird appears to be gliding lazily, it is actually very active. Its outer wing feathers are in constant motion, catching up-drafts of warm air, and steering the bird through moving air currents.<br>Like other objects, which are heavier than air, birds in flight are constantly falling. When a bird is in an up-draft of warm air, it is carried up more quickly than it falls. At this time, it can fly higher.<br>The bird now tries to keep itself in this column of air by steering with its wing and tail feathers. When the bird moves into a column of downward cooler air, it falls rapidly.<br>However, it now uses its wings to help it glide, as quickly as possible into another column of upward moving warm air. The speed that the bird attained while gliding downward in the cool column enables it to sweep upward more quickly when it enters the warm column."}
