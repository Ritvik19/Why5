{"Title": "How Were Continents Formed?", "Article": "<img src=\"data/contitental-drift.jpg\"><br>Millions of years ago, the movement of tectonic plates over the Earth\u2019s rocky shell or mantle, brought land masses into collision with each other. The collision was so violent that mountains were formed as the existing continents smashed together to form one giant super continent. About 300 million years ago, during the time of dinosaurs, earth didn\u2019t have seven continents, but instead one supercontinent called <b>Pangaea</b>, surrounded by a single ocean called <b>Panthalassa</b>. Later Pangaea started to break apart into two supercontinents. They were <b>Gondwana</b> & <b>Laurasia</b>. More mountains were formed, and parts of the continents that had been inland were now on the coast, and this changed the climate in many areas."}
