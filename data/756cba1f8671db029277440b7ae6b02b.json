{"Title": "What Is the Relationship Between A Hermit Crab and A Sea Anemone?", "Article": "<img src=\"data/hermit-crab-sea-anemone.jpg\"><br>Hermit crabs live in castoff mollusc shells for protection. The crab has an amazing relationship with sea anemones. Sea anemones are brightly coloured, flower like creatures, with stinging cells. These cells explode at the slightest touch.<br>But the hermit crabs regularly carry sea anemones with them. They plant then on their banks, and when they move to another shell, they will take their resident sea anemones on them.<br>This cooperation works well for both the partners. The sea anemones get a free ride to places where food is available, and eat food particles left by crab. The crab, in turn, is protected from enemies by the singing cells of sea anemones."}
