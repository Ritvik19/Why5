{"Title": "Why Do Bats Hang Upside Down?", "Article": "<img src=\"data/bat.jpg\"><br>They are not able to lift enough from the ground to launch, nor do they have enough strength in their hind legs to get a running start or take-off. But by simply dropping down from a cave ceiling or tree branch, a bat can quickly and effectively achieve flight.<br>Being able to dangle from their feet gives them more options when looking for places to roost (the ceilings of caves mostly). And napping in these hard-to-reach, isolated spots helps them avoid predators, mainly birds of prey, that are active during the day when bats are sleeping and therefore at their most vulnerable state.<br>The tendons in bats' feet travel through a rough sheath-like structure in their ankles that closes tight upon the tendon when the ends of it are pulled. So, when they cling to ceilings or branches the pull of their body weight downward stretches that sheath and locks their feet in place, letting them relax their muscles and exert zero energy.<br>Now for the circulation I thought that since they have a strong muscular heart and very little blood because they are small creatures as compared to any other mammalians, gravity doesn't affect their circulation, thus freeing them from the tremendous pressure that would afflict any large animal that hangs upside down."}
