{"Title": "Have You Ever Wondered What's That Whitish Streak Behind A Rocket or Airplane?", "Article": "<img src=\"data/airplane-whitish-streak.jpg\"><br><br>These are called CONTRAILS (artificial clouds).<br>Contrails is shorter version of condensation trail.<br>As the hot exhaust air escapes from the airplane engine. At high altitudes as this water vapor emerges into a cold environment (at greater heights temperature is low), the localized increase in water vapor can raise the relative humidity of the air past saturation point. The vapor then condenses into tiny water droplets which freeze if the temperature is low enough. These millions of tiny water droplets or ice crystals form the contrails.<br>During combustion of fuel+ air in aircraft gas turbine engine, water (H2O) vapor is one of the major products and is exhausted out. So, water per se isn't there, in that form (H2O) in the fuel / air to begin with (other than some little quantity of humidity in air), but is produced in good quantities during combustion. It's the same phenomenon you notice from your vehicle engine too."}
