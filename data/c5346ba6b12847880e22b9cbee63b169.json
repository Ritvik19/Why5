{"Title": "What is Quartz?", "Article": "<img src=\"data/quartz.jpg\"><br>Quartz is a type of rock made out of molecules of silicon and oxygen atom that are held together in a crystal pattern. Clocks are made using this mineral. When a quartz mineral is squeezed it generates a very small current of electricity. This also means that when electricity is passed through the quartz crystal, it vibrates. Quartz crystals all vibrate at the same frequency. This principle is used in clocks. All quartz clocks contain a battery to vibrate the crystal, and a circuit to count how many times the crystal has shaken. The circuit then uses this information to create regular pulses of electricity. It generates one pulse every second. These pulses then make the gears of the clock move. In case of digital clocks the movement of the gears powers the digital display. <br>The first watch that used the quartz crystal was mad in1969 by Seiko, a Japanese company."}
