{"Title": "Will Mother Birds Reject Their Babies If They've Been Touched By Humans?", "Article": "<img src=\"data/bird-nest.jpg\"><br>\n<b>Myth:</b><br>\nMother birds will reject their babies if they've been touched by humans..<br>\n<b>How It Started:</b><br>\nWell-meaning humans who find a chick on the ground may want to return the baby bird to the nest. But the bird is probably learning to fly and shouldn't be disturbed. The tale may have been invented to keep people from handling young birds.<br>\n<b>Why It's Not True:</b><br>\n\"Most birds have a poorly developed sense of smell,\" says Michael Mace, bird curator at San Diego Zoo's Wild Animal Park. \"They won't notice a human scent.\" One exception: vultures, who sniff out dead animals for dinner. But you wouldn't want to mess with a vulture anyway!"}
