{"Title": "What Are First World, Second World and Third World Countries?", "Article": "These terms have become antiquated and their definitions serve little or almost no purpose as of now. These \u2018worlds' were conceptualized to refer to the geopolitical blocs formed from the cold war post WW2.<br><br><img src=\"data/first-second-third-world.jpg\"><br><br>Countries in red represent First World, green for Second World and Blue for the Third World.<br>First-world countries were those countries which adhered to the capitalist-democratic ideology. United States of America, United Kingdom, Canada, South Korea and most of Western European countries were first-world nations.<br>The communist sphere of USSR (United Soviet Socialist Republic) made up the second world. They were proponents of communism-socialism. Contemporary Russia, Cuba, China and rest of the states formed from the collapse of Soviet Union, such as Kazakhstan, Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia all are second-world countries.<br>Countries which refused to side to any of these blocs were the third world countries. The Group of 77 was formed by these nations called Non-Aligned Movement (NAM). This includes Brazil, Mexico, India, Pakistan, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, Sweden and many others.<br>After the collapse of Soviet Union in 1991, use of these terms have become redundant. Nowadays, developed countries are usually called first-world countries, which are industrially advanced, democratic with high HDI. The developing nations are usually referred to as Third World Countries, which are poor, economically underdeveloped with low HDI."}
