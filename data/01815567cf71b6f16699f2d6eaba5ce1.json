{"Title": "Why Does It Feel As If the Moon Is Following Us Wherever We Go?", "Article": "When you travel by train, the houses and trees outside seem to be rushing backwards. However how fast you travel, the moon and the stars do not rush backwards, but seem to move along with you. Why is this?<br>When things are near us, we move past them very quickly. After that, we don\u2019t see them anymore that is why trees and houses seem to rush past at great speed.<br>But, when things are far away, we\u2019ll see them for a longer period, since it takes a longer time to go past them. This explains why distant objects like mountains don\u2019t seem to rush past the window of a moving train.<br>We know, the moon is very far from us. Because of its great distance, the angle at which we view the moon changes very little as we move.<br>Even if we travel 200km/hr, it remains in relatively the same position in the sky. So, wherever you go, the moon appears to be in the same position, almost as though it I following you."}
