{"Title": "How Life Began on Earth?", "Article": "<img src=\"data/life.jpg\"><br>\nThe first forms of life on Earth were primitive, single-celled organisms like bacteria that appeared about 3 billion years ago. Multi-cellular life evolved over a billion years later, and its only in last 570 million years that the kind of life forms we are familiar with began to evolve. The first of these were arthropods, or soft bodied worm like creatures that lived in the seas, followed by fish that filled the oceans.<br>\nSome marine animals crawled on to the shore, and evolved into amphibians and land animals. Aquatic plants evolved into land plants, which in turn became forests. Mammals evolved only 200 million years ago, and early man just 200,00 years back\u2026"}
