{"Title": "Why Did People Of France Gift The Statue of Liberty to USA?", "Article": "<img src=\"data/statue-of-liberty.jpg\"><br>When you think of the USA, the first thing that comes to the mind is the Statue of Liberty- a colossal statue of the Roman goddess- Libertas holding aloft a torch, facing the Atlantic Ocean. The Statue of Liberty was a gift from the people of France to the citizens of the USA to celebrate the 100th year of the Declaration of Independence, which fell on the 4th of July, 1876. <br>The Statue of Liberty stands on Liberty Island, in the New York Bay. It is over 93 meters tall. It is made of pure copper, and holds a gold plated torch in one hand to welcome those arriving in America from across the ocean. The left hand holds a stone tablet representing the Declaration of Independence. There are broken chains representing freedom from bonds at the feet of the statue, and on its head, there is a crown with seven points. These seven points symbolize the seven seas and seven continents- and also the fact that people from all over the world are welcome in America. <br>The Statue of Liberty was designed by French sculptor Auguste Bartholdi."}
