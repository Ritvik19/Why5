Which is to prove his victory over death. It is to prove to all mankind that we will arise from death, so death is not the end of all, from mortality to immortality.<br>During his second coming, those who are dead in him will arise first. Then those who are alive and lives in him in spirit will be caught up and taken with him. For others he will judge them.<br>So, these two days are very significant for what Jesus Christ has done for mankind. To renew a relationship with almighty God, to make a way for us to inherit the kingdom of God."}
