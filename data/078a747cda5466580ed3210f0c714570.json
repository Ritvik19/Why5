{"Title": "Why Is There a Liquid Part at The Bottom of The Refill of a Gel Pen?", "Article": "<img src=\"data/gel-pen.jpg\"><br><br>The ink that is present inside the refill of a gel pen consists of different components.<br>It contains:<br>1. Pigments.<br>These provide colour to the ink.<br>Copper phthalocyanine is used as a pigment for blue colour.<br>Iron oxides are used as pigments for red colour ink.<br>In gel-pens, pigments are present at high proportions.<br>2. Gel.<br>This is composed of water and some biopolymers like tragacanth gum and xanthan gum.<br>It provides a medium for the pigments.<br>The gel creates a proper flow of ink, from the body of the refill to the tip.<br>3. Thickeners.<br>This is a substance which increases the viscosity of a liquid, without changing its physical and chemical properties.<br>Polyacrylate Thickeners are used in gel pens. It is known for its adhesive properties.<br>This holds the entire gel properly and prohibits the constant flow.<br>Thus, gel pens have ink in which pigments are suspended water-based gel.<br>We are concerned about the water-based gel here. If it is kept directly\u2026 It will evaporate.<br>To stop this evaporation from happening, we insert a silicone paste at the end of a refill.<br>So, the transparent liquid part at the end of a refill is actually a high viscosity paste made from a silicone-based compound.<br>We use silicone, particularly, because it is water-resistant. So, it doesn\u2019t mix with the water-based gel.<br>In addition to stopping the evaporation of gel, this paste also works as a stopper fluid, i.e. it stops the ink from flowing out from the bottom side."}
