{"Title": "How Does Ironing Remove Wrinkles?", "Article": "Every time you wash your clothes you can see wrinkles formed on them. This is because the water that clothes are washed in disturbs the molecular arrangement of the fabric, which then appears as wrinkles.<br>Ironing heats the molecules within the fabric, so they become loose. The pressure of the weight exerted by the iron flattens the fabric. When the fabric cools, it retains the new flat shape, and will be wrinkle free."}
