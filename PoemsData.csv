My heart and OW! Freeze
Dried my bandaid right off.
And then the glasses shopping
Memories today yada yada
Wasn’t about the cum shot
Where or if, was about the
Islands and how you said
in the langue d’enemie
No less: “DON’T TOUCH”

Don’t Touch!? We just …
They fucked you up all right.
You give so clearly but have iced
Out all the incoming gifts. WELL
PING my darling Walden island.
I can’t take that kind of cold.
I’m leaving Las Vegas.
Just a moon in Taurus trying
To sing the sweet and
It’s not a great user experience

But I just want you to know
How unforgettable you are


When the candles call to Hera
I hope they melt your
I hope a goddess or many
Wash that loneliness away
And when I see you again (in 15 years)
There’s only joy and more

I prefer you laughing to tears
The good way. Drink us when
We’re done. Well, I guess I did
Almost kill you with a
Razor shave once so it
Seems silly to say I’m sorry I
Lost the phantom thread.
Maybe everything’s a ridiculous
never-ending non-planet
Tho, u did kiss me like unicorns
Exist and bond our skin
Like the organ it deserves to be
Known as


To know how unforgettable
you are because there
lies the bridge to the
Mainland. & baby, you
Deserve it all.

devastatingly bizarre the way

Nation of Domination
my mom hugs me & wants me to stay. i have my foot
on the pedal. a fake gold chain on my neck. i confess
i’m a sucker. i never want magicians to reveal their secrets.
i want to live in the unknowing where everything is possible.
my mom dances with me to Los Bukis. she thinks this makes
me her baby still. perspective is a magic trick. i hit my brother
with the Rock Bottom & i bet you can guess what i leave out.
ask Farooq if you need a hint. the brain is full of magic
i don’t understand. no one signs up to take a dive. in wrestling,
there’s a team of writers who decide who wins and who loses.
the metaphor is obvious. my mom wasn’t born to play the role
of mom, i don’t care how many baby dolls she played with.
i dance with my mom to Los Bukis & you’re a fool
if you believe it’s her son she’s trying to hold on to.

moonshine
the poets are right about the moonlight.
i take my spot of sky & deposit it
into a savings account. only after
the bank confiscated our house
did i understand. roses
don’t grow without pricked hands.
i didn’t have to spend a summer in a freezer
packing lunch meat to know the value
of sunlight. my mom didn’t have
to spend a decade wiping down floors to appreciate
education. when i give you a bouquet of roses,
i give you a bouquet of bloody hands.
a handful of dirt & the worms that doted on your roses.
when i take my piece of sky out of the bank,
it’s smaller. the drunks are right about moonshine.
 
Victoria MartinezHoyne, 2018, collage, 15 × 10 in.
                            
Shelter Island
frigid are the branches of black trees cutting through
a blacker night. missing are the lampposts that adorn
every few feet of New York. cold is your hand in my hand
& yes, i am a man, & you are a woman. my wilderness
is not unlike the woods that surround us. the sky in my wild
lit by lanterns in the faces of animals. my own flammable face.
my father’s temperament. my thrifted excuse. yes,
it’s the night before 45 is sworn in as president,
& yes, we leave the city, & we would leave the planet, too.
you hold my hand & we walk into the teeth of the hour
armed with each other. bitter cold is the world we leave behind.
when we hold hands, we invent a spaceship.

my mom hugs me & wants me to stay. i have my foot
on the pedal. a fake gold chain on my neck. i confess
i’m a sucker. i never want magicians to reveal their secrets.
i want to live in the unknowing where everything is possible.
my mom dances with me to Los Bukis. she thinks this makes
me her baby still. perspective is a magic trick. i hit my brother
with the Rock Bottom & i bet you can guess what i leave out.
ask Farooq if you need a hint. the brain is full of magic
i don’t understand. no one signs up to take a dive. in wrestling,
there’s a team of writers who decide who wins and who loses.
the metaphor is obvious. my mom wasn’t born to play the role
of mom, i don’t care how many baby dolls she played with.
i dance with my mom to Los Bukis & you’re a fool
if you believe it’s her son she’s trying to hold on to.

moonshine
the poets are right about the moonlight.
i take my spot of sky & deposit it
into a savings account. only after
the bank confiscated our house
did i understand. roses
don’t grow without pricked hands.
i didn’t have to spend a summer in a freezer
packing lunch meat to know the value
of sunlight. my mom didn’t have
to spend a decade wiping down floors to appreciate
education. when i give you a bouquet of roses,
i give you a bouquet of bloody hands.
a handful of dirt & the worms that doted on your roses.
when i take my piece of sky out of the bank,
it’s smaller. the drunks are right about moonshine.

Shelter Island
frigid are the branches of black trees cutting through
a blacker night. missing are the lampposts that adorn
every few feet of New York. cold is your hand in my hand
& yes, i am a man, & you are a woman. my wilderness
is not unlike the woods that surround us. the sky in my wild
lit by lanterns in the faces of animals. my own flammable face.
my father’s temperament. my thrifted excuse. yes,
it’s the night before 45 is sworn in as president,
& yes, we leave the city, & we would leave the planet, too.
you hold my hand & we walk into the teeth of the hour
armed with each other. bitter cold is the world we leave behind.
when we hold hands, we invent a spaceship.

By Ashanti Anderson
You are dark as religion. Remember God could not have named a modicum of light without you. You are plum, black currant, passion fruit in another woman’s garden. You are Black as and as if by magic. Black not as sin, but a cave’s jaw clamped shut by forgiveness. Color of closed wombs and bellies of ships, you, dark as not the tree trunk but its every cleft. I chart each crescent moon rising above fingernail and rub together my thighs for want of you. I try to find you where the pages of books meet. You hang where men or piano keys segregate. When I miss you, I remember the hickey the sun left on the back of my neck. If I forget, I smoke blunts down to my fingertips and beg you to come on my lips. This is how I pray for you when I’m not pessimistic. I bow to your darkness like I kneel beside a child’s bed, confessing as gospel, there’s no monster here.

It is definitely marvelous                    to be as attenuated

I’m 31, and like everything else that too can be fun
or a bummer, a drain on the cosmic energy, depending on what?
If you know the answer you win the future;
if you don’t the future is ours to lose or—
whatever happened to the old way of construction?
Well, one line still follows another, and my voices moves
between each space, and when I think of you I sweat,
or maybe just imagine myself like a cartoon troublemaker
big beads of perspiration jumping out from my skin as I
cringe behind the fence that the bully is about to
throw a bomb over, or drop an anvil over, or just put his
meaty fist through and right on into my scared shitless grin,
the analogy resting on our mutual vulnerability—
that’s poetry isn’t it?

*

Of course I don’t talk like this.
I talk like this.

*
And now it’s time to go back to THE HISTORY OF ROCK’N’ROLL
which means it’s my night to cook dinner for “the house”—
collective—and it’s gonna be smoked sausage cooked in peppers
and mushrooms and carrots, maybe some onions, and beans
for protein, or something nutritional. I picked the sausage
because it seemed to be looking at me in the Safeway,
not exactly the way I was looking at one of the cashiers,
a young man with curly blonde hair and nice build
who seemed to have a down home kind of friendliness,
or the woman with the little girl the same sizes as Miles,
who is a little smaller than Caitlin, both of whom were
pulling on my pants leg for pennies for gumballs as I watched
the curve of the woman’s arm as she placed each
well thought over item on the counter behind my
vibrational buying and didn’t even notice how much I fell in love
with her arm and felt guilty for objectifying a part of her
although she might all be like her arm and then I might
fall in love with all of her, but that would cause problems,
she probably is already in love with at least one person, and
I’m already in love with about fourteen on a regular basis, and
that keeps causing all kinds of problems because people who are
attracted to my style don’t like my ways—that sounded like
a pretentious folk singing prodigy’s idea of an early Dylan line,
but what I meant would never be explained right in a poem like this,
or one like Anne Waldman’s either though I like to read hers
because they make me want to write, and in my world that’s what
“great” writers are supposed to do–make everyone else, or
at least me, feel like I can write too, and then make me feel,
like I will, and then I do.

*

After dinner we’ll eat the cake Atticus made for my birthday
there’ll be some presents from some of the people in the house, and
maybe Annie will stop over, or Matthew might call from work, or we
might all go down to watch him make salads at
FOOD FOR THOUGHT,
and maybe eat some too, all along getting stoned on the house doobie,
which goes too fast these days but never fast enough, which is
about the way I feel on my birthday about my life, either that or
the way I’m easily satisfied but never feel I can get too much–
sometimes everything is enough, you know?

*

HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO ME, HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO ME,
I THINK I JUST HEARD CHUCK COME IN, CAITLIN’S
ANGRY WITH ME AND THROWING A TANTRUM IN
HER ROOM, IT’S RAINING BUT I HEAR THE DISHES
BEING DONE FINALLY BY SOMEONE ELSE
HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO ME

*
Resolution: No more guilt trips
from outside or inside
going either direction
–is everybody happy?

There is no delusion that she wants her. Is marriage like owning a very expensive art piece? Your spouse the painting? You the crooked frame that won’t fit? Is this how desire is born? From having less or from wanting more? She wakes up calling her name. She wakes up knowing that she doesn’t want less. From House of Cards she learned a new rule: “I love that woman. I love her more than sharks love blood.” Or something along that line. She may have misquoted. It came out of the pre-disgraced Kevin Spacey’s mouth. Her God doesn’t exercise telepathy or residence. Hands, eyes, mouths, authenticity. It’s a city without mirrors. Because touch, in itself, is symmetry. — She held the woman’s face in her mind’s eye & realized that they would never be lovers & as soon as she let her go, mosses grew all over the geography of her hands and the woman’s face. Is this because it’s a debt that must be paid for not believing in somebody? In herself? She felt the desire of desire as if it was a binchōtan charcoal and its ash. Masakichi Yakitori and the Pyramid Club. — On Easter Sunday, she sang a Christmas carol of Lao Tzu. Lao Tzu, where is your power to persuade a tree from falling asleep on itself? Does night dream of actresses sleeping on leaves? Where is the human figure in this? Your Saturday is a memory without a body. A pair of lungs that knew too much about your mother’s rape tells you to leave reality through a threshold of a dream. You knew how to be authentic. How to get rid of people. How desertion works in the wilderness. You exclude sound from your thesis. It’s a way for you to desert poetry without being too poetic. — There were thistles inside of your mother’s vaginal canal. She wasn’t violated in the wilderness. He has dragged her there to say that it was okay to want pins and needles. She wasn’t numbed after all. Her body didn’t pretend to be a God. Just a whimpered Lao Tzu. In a remote mountain, the men are smoking pipes and their vapors smell like evergreen. To punctuate their desire she says: God is being difficult. But he is not. I have to tell the world that I am sad and have been forgotten. Is there a way home from not being homeless? Is there a way to swim in an Indian reservation without being caught? Listen: the isotope was just a trope. There are ways to move smoothly in and out of insincerity. We grow to learn how to brush melted butter onto doughs shaped like the cavalry. They arrive galloping on the baking sheets without yeast in their armors. — Every Tuesday we acquire clues from the shape of your mother’s scream. When it was hoarse, it had the shape of a small bonsai tree. Your cat licks you and licks you. You know it’s not 300 bc. Desire comes and goes while leaving lies to clothe themselves. Her anger is a troublesome candidate of sadness— lights itself on fire. From time to time, the cunt of that fire grows ember by ember. Once in a while, a house made of screams floats down a black river on the planet Pluto. Its chimney is not designed to ventilate silence or resilience. It’s designed to allow screams to escape without suffocating everyone inside it. Once in a while the rain arrives to suppress the anger of the scream. When anger soaks like wet grasses on the house’s floorboard, the ants come out to showcase their military might. They resurrected the screams from their wet ash and carry them on their powerful backs. The aftermath of a rape is portable and transmutable. A possible somatic experience for the ants, but may not be for the human or the inhuman.

She held the woman’s face in her mind’s eye &
realized that they would never be lovers &
as soon as she let her go, mosses grew all over
the geography of her hands and the woman’s face.

Is this because it’s a debt that must be paid for

Lao Tzu, where is your power to persuade a tree from falling

Every Tuesday we acquire clues from the shape
of your mother’s scream.
When it was hoarse, it had the shape of a small bonsai tree.

Your cat licks you and licks you.

You know it’s not 300 bc.
Desire comes and goes while leaving lies to clothe themselves.

Her anger is a troublesome candidate of sadness—
lights itself on fire.
From time to time, the cunt of that fire grows ember by ember.

Once in a while, a house made of screams floats down a black river
on the planet Pluto.
Its chimney is not designed to ventilate silence or resilience.
It’s designed to allow screams to escape without suffocating
everyone inside it.

Once in a while the rain arrives to suppress the anger of the
scream.

When anger soaks like wet grasses on the house’s floorboard, the
ants come out to showcase their military might.

They resurrected the screams from their wet ash and carry them
on their powerful backs.
The aftermath of a rape is portable and transmutable.
A possible somatic experience for the ants, but may not be for the
human or the inhuman.

—


Our earth can’t live without holy rites.
You can see this from the sky.

Lots of hills to climb up and down.
A straight ravine between.

Snow figures engraved in stones.
Show streaks of sun gone but
The white rocks shrink and grow
Grave at sunset.



Turn to the right
And you will fall to the left.

One figure wears a beard
Down to his chest

But Eros hates coverings.
And prefers to be caught naked

With his bow and arrow.

Embellishes
But clears the way for pathos.

—


From above I covet a mountain beneath my feet.

Shrines made of dung and branches,
With berries for eyes and burlap hung with holly.
They were curled in shadows on roads
Leading to every stop we made from the Trig

To Top Withens to Liverpool.
The white and purple mountains.
Stood over the Brontës and clusters
Of black thistles’ script.

I remember a church (a cave supported
By old bicycle parts to keep it up)
Was bound by a broken bell and a box
Containing snapshots and trinkets.



“We will get through this!”

—


Why mercy?

Having mercy on someone is easier than forgiving them.

That one there?

A man limited by logic, he imprisoned the people whose thinking was infinite.

And her, the serious one?

Stars without light hold the others up.

I lost you for a moment.

Mid-sentence is darker so you can’t decipher it.
Look up.

Oyster, shell pink, sky inside. Our prison.

What would you tell the judge?

The difference between a man who shoots others and then himself and one who shoots others and runs away.

You will tell her that decisions are only guesses.
“Resentment is a weak form of suicide.”

That’s why suicide is hard to choose even when you’re dying.
“I wish they would shoot themselves before they shot the others.”

—


We’ve evolved (arrived) just in time for the obsolete.

The center that runs along the sides of the tarmac
Is a camp without a name.
A holding station.

A glass of narcotics, a warm blanket, steam for suffocation,
For each passenger of any class.

“Did you know a rendition is an interpretation, an
explanation of something not clear?”

“It’s also persecution and surrender,
Translation and the handing over
Of prisoners to countries
Where detention is.”
Pass through customs in silence.
The red strings of radiation
Will only burn your bed-skins.
Do not joke or rhyme with bomb.

“If you have a passport, bless it.”

—


Now the wing is whitening, its patches quiver
on the steel and fragment into petals that are either living or not.
In grade one I watched the lights of cars passing on the bedroom wall
for surely they were messages flying at the speed of light.
And aren’t they still?



In the sky there are few signs of progress.
Tongues wag and sailors pull their beards.
Some have pictures of naked women, some have boys.

It’s fractal, a science student whispers to nobody special.

—


There is a wonderful kidnapped hunted raped and betrayed girl
In fairy tales. She has a name, but the vowels and subjects
Around can’t be switched to fit.

She wants to escape but letters won’t let her.

She never thinks about darkness or dying because they’re natural
And don’t require thought.

She carries her darkness everywhere.
What is not natural

Is being here an utter stranger.
And flight being no metaphor.

—


What if the outcome of an act burst into color.
All that fruit skin dimpled from the touch of branches.
The oranges falling when the creatures below were hungry.

Each wink of an eyelid presaged a long look at a winter
That would come eons later.

What if you stood when I entered.

What if you think of time as a long and everlasting plain,
You can pass across it any which way you turn.
And walk around the pond with your father again.

—


I had a garden of my own
For twenty-one years.
Seven trees times three
Planted for the first children.

Oh its land was a meadow
And our little house, a grape arbor
And a Wampanoag
Grave in a grove of elms.

Then a tree like an elephant
Bucked in a storm.
And its trunk broke into
A wrinkled little stump.

Roots don’t give up.

And stones only breathe once a year.

Many people passed through.
We could have watered more
Or flowered a path
For the visitors. After all

Love meant life and its shadow.
Children played and grew.
I too grew old for no reason.
Love stood at a distance.

One day the snow will camouflage
The huddling April buds
Before a cherry-picker
Damns all but one, the littlest.

—


At least I know when the wild geese
Fly from Sepiessa.
They herd the future
As it approaches the bench.

Night ... the playground
At Town Hall is creaking
And tribal members
Now numbered

In the twos are too early for sun-up.


We almost sit together
But our feet of shadows
Show failed land deals.
Steps lowered and slimy

On a slip into the lagoon.
Ghoulish are the ghosts
Of time past: ancestors
With our same names.

—


Pensées sauvages: wild pansies, like violets, have the shape of thoughts, savage thoughts, colored thoughts, sprung from a stem.

Purple and yellow. Five petals.

Once Cupid shot an arrow dipped in the ink of a pansy into the eyelid of a sleeping child.

From then on the child saw cirrus colors at dawn, dawn
being where iridescence grows flowers.

It’s so flat here you can see everything. It’s not romantic. Nobody can slip in or out in secret, and who among us has pumped the last worry through her heart?
Collapsing into shade, I wish for more sons, endless daughters: a higher ratio of my people to other people. Why not want what I want; since we used all the air conditioning it’s become impossible to think things through.
Can you believe your ears? All the electric music in the world has been turned into handbells. I wish I had a cushion for my knees instead of gloves to keep the handbells pure. We can get used to anything. That doesn’t mean we should.
I went to a wedding where everything was outrageous but trying to act  modest by including very goofy elements, such as people in bear costumes and gold nuggets descending from the ceiling, only to be jerked back up out of reach when people tried to grab them.
Long ago, a matrimonial family collected a few eggs from each household in the village to contribute to the wedding cake. A pig for the dinner: a gift from a rich great-uncle. Shortly after, there was a period of department store gift services and electro-synth harps for hire.
But now we pick dandelions to make wine, and pluck chickens to make fine the groom’s cloak. He wants large brown wings; he wants wolf pelt for his loins. He wants he wants he wants. There is no end to that.
The bride is someone who has only ever served. No use asking someone who’s once had a true taste of freedom, whose eyes widened and whose pelvis thrust up unbidden. Better she be someone who might never know what she lost.
It is as it ever was. How many centuries have brides been made and used in this way?
How few centuries have let women be girls first, swirling as long as they wanted into their sweetness and sharpening to ripeness, only becoming women once full heavy love was their desire inside and out. Maybe one. Maybe not quite one full century.

I’m talking about a prospect wherein

vision gets unhooked from the sockets. & no it’s not
a love song about blindness or the way

she moves. rather it is standing
in the midst of nothing & the wind passing

since seeing was always a curse, the boundary
between things floating

up to foil how anyone might touch
or travel. unless we can find a non-

delineated dance proliferating otherwise
in the unhasty unfolding of we’re already there

à la Hegel re: Kant, & not like
that Caspar David Friedrich painting either

(some solitary man-figure surveying
what was already his so it becomes his again)

but instead unvisioning the world, not like
Heidegger, obviously, not the thing at hand

but like the hand repeating a motion
forever, writing her beloved like this is politics

this is the end of all endings
& the wind

Thinking.
Wondering if
my trot to Paris
to suffer you
wasn’t all wrong.
My amour fou

precise as a shark
collecting scents
miles off,
exact as a saint
cowed before
invisible wings

rustling
abstract sheets?
Your eyes
green, and red
your hair,
iconic in this

television universe
of one man
let nothing on,
no “real” Twitter feed
surrendering candid
portraits of what

you believe,
what you love.
And I sit, subtracted,
before my love.
Wondering.
Subjected

as I was
to plural echoes
nth parts sensual,
nth parts trust,
and to hear there
a call

to illegitimate Paris
where I fit
right in,
Jacques Brel songbook,
ukulele, bread
and wine, simulacral

maudit bohemian
pelted by Polanski-ish
rain, but happy
away from Los Angeles
where you fit in,
being able, in one city,

to drive for hours
and never leave home.
My choked voice grumbled
“de chrysanthèmes ...”
(Brel song) as
I sought the streets

of Apollinaire’s “Zone”
on Google maps
(which I paid dearly
for)
still hearing the
angel

even as
you were angry with me
who nearly destroyed
your apartment’s electricity
plugging in some idiotic
gadget of mine

and leaving it smoking
drunk on uke, bread and wine.
Hard not to think
this symbolic
or a great way to pep
up an episode

of Friends, or an ancient
Merchant Ivory film.
If I were Anne Carson
you’d be translation
and I
an impotent scholar

before the Greek,
drawn by love
to the undecided
omnivorous Word
that paints travelogue,
that shields Earth,

begging
this word side with me
when I touch down in Paris,
that it’s you who’d
ground this polysemous
text

with a kiss, or touch
puppyish, unambiguous.
Oh, that Anne
Carson, such a genius.
She makes
me think.

I’ve never been
so wrong, and in
the wrong place,
a foreigner, foreigned
in my own goddamned
country

by double negation
fitting right
in (as I’ve
said) and you
a Mediterranean accent
amidst the stones

of French abstraction,
pride, often cruelty,
noirs désirs
circling like bats
who’ve read too much Saint-Just
and mistaken it for Sade.

(That sounds quite important.
I’m afraid it’s not.)
It rained. I wrote
a pining song
in a hotel room
refusing your offer

to stay with you
and your boyfriend
(quelle horreur)
who spoke no French
while I
conducted vertiginous conversations

with a curator
at the Musée Gustave Moreau
pinning my hopes
on words like “Gautier” (Théophile)
“Mallarmé” and “Rimbaud”
(who didn’t come up

of course),
and marred the language
even further with the help
of Google translate
in my letters to you
in the guise of, who?

it wasn’t Baudelaire
(I can’t remember who,
maybe Marat,
and you, Charlotte Corday).
I liked the pining song,
in the end,

it’s Morrissey-esque, funny
but grim, slippery
and only incomplete
without (or with) you.
Here I do not
go again,

merely think
flat-footed
on my horizon
(scratching
my itchy head, I
think I have dandruff)

while you
sleep
in a Westwood Airbnb
lyrically, so
I am drawn
shark-angelly

down Hollywood Blvd.
on the 302
to an American-style
aperitivo
with sliders instead
of funicular olives

again with you
talking,
and I gazing deep
into your colors,
reading your Tweets
but never commenting.

Such lovely olives.
It’s a beautiful evening.

Spawn of fantasies
Sifting the appraisable
Pig Cupid his rosy snout
Rooting erotic garbage
""Once upon a time""
Pulls a weed white star-topped
Among wild oats sown in mucous membrane
I would an eye in a Bengal light
Eternity in a sky-rocket
Constellations in an ocean
Whose rivers run no fresher
Than a trickle of saliva

These are suspect places

I must live in my lantern
Trimming subliminal flicker
Virginal to the bellows
Of experience
Colored glass.



II

At your mercy
Our Universe
Is only
A colorless onion
You derobe
Sheath by sheath
Remaining
A disheartening odour
About your nervy hands

Curled to the solitaire
Core of the

Evolution fall foul of
Sexual equality
Prettily miscalculate
Similitude

Unnatural selection
Breed such sons and daughters
As shall jibber at each other
Uninterpretable cryptonyms
Under the moon

Give them some way of braying brassily
For caressive calling
Or to homophonous hiccoughs
Transpose the laugh
Let them suppose that tears
Are snowdrops or molasses
Or anything
Than human insufficiences
Begging dorsal vertebrae

Let meeting be the turning
To the antipodean
And Form a blur
Anything
Than to seduce them
To the one
As simple satisfaction
For the other

Shuttle-cock and battle-door
A little pink-love
And feathers are strewn



VI

Let Joy go solace-winged
To flutter whom she may concern



VII

Once in a mezzanino
The starry ceiling
Vaulted an unimaginable family
Bird-like abortions
With human throats
And Wisdom's eyes
Who wore lamp-shade red dresses
And woolen hair

One bore a baby
In a padded porte-enfant
Tied with a sarsenet ribbon
To her goose's wings

But for the abominable shadows
I would have lived
Among their fearful furniture
To teach them to tell me their secrets
Before I guessed
-- Sweeping the brood clean out

Midnight empties the street

--- One wing has been washed in rain
The other will never be clean any more ---
Pulling door-bells to remind
Those that are snug
To the right a haloed ascetic
Threading houses
Probes wounds for souls
--- The poor can't wash in hot water ---
And I don't know which turning to take ---



IX

We might have coupled
In the bed-ridden monopoly of a moment
Or broken flesh with one another
At the profane communion table
Where wine is spill't on promiscuous lips

We might have given birth to a butterfly
With the daily-news
Printed in blood on its wings

Green things grow
Salads

Forager's revival

Rolling in the sun

I love you, rotten,
Delicious rottenness.

I love to suck you out from your skins
So brown and soft and coming suave,
So morbid, as the Italians say.

What a rare, powerful, reminiscent flavour
Comes out of your falling through the stages of decay:
Stream within stream.

Something of the same flavour as Syracusan muscat wine
Or vulgar Marsala.

Though even the word Marsala will smack of preciosity
Soon in the pussy-foot West.

What is it?
What is it, in the grape turning raisin,
In the medlar, in the sorb-apple,
Wineskins of brown morbidity,
Autumnal excrementa;
What is it that reminds us of white gods?

Gods nude as blanched nut-kernels,
Strangely, half-sinisterly flesh-fragrant
As if with sweat,
And drenched with mystery.

Sorb-apples, medlars with dead crowns.
I say, wonderful are the hellish experiences,
Orphic, delicate
Dionysos of the Underworld.

A kiss, and a vivid spasm of farewell, a moment’s orgasm of rupture,
Then along the damp road alone, till the next turning.
And there, a new partner, a new parting, a new unfusing into twain,
A new gasp of further isolation,
A new intoxication of loneliness, among decaying, frost-cold leaves.

Going down the strange lanes of hell, more and more intensely alone,
The fibres of the heart parting one after the other
And yet the soul continuing, naked-footed, ever more vividly embodied
Like a flame blown whiter and whiter
In a deeper and deeper darkness,
Ever more exquisite, distilled in separation.

So, in the strange retorts of medlars and sorb-apples
The distilled essence of hell.
The exquisite odour of leave-taking. Jamque vale!
Orpheus, and the winding, leaf-clogged, silent lanes of hell.

Each soul departing with its own isolation.
Strangest of all strange companions,
And best.

Medlars, sorb-apples
More than sweet
Flux of autumn
Sucked out of your empty bladders
And sipped down, perhaps, with a sip of Marsala
So that the rambling, sky-dropped grape can add its music to yours,
Orphic farewell, and farewell, and farewell
And the ego sum of Dionysos
The sono io of perfect drunkenness
Intoxication of final loneliness.

hear no:        I offer bone as offering, I shake bone around to anyone good who may be listening.



What’s mine is yours even if it’s only bone dust.
We live openhearted and without fear.


In the triple-X fantasies,
I’m the puppy. I bring back the dead
a sign of—what?
Surrender? Having, out in the wilderness,
thought of you?



Invoke your
proximate sanctuary, string antidotes together like beads.

cat piss—rancher—rearview spider—wasp nest
dead dad blanket for the coldest nights—mountain pass—
antelope—taking a shit under a rainbow in a field of ponies, in Oregon           (how that actually happened)





I know your secret
I too have dropped entire         days into my thigh
Nights and galaxies, termites     of testosterone week after
week slow as money even slower when it               crystallizes. I think you are
beautiful                                                         in me
small shocks I did not know I’d                    bottom for,

which is not a secret.      Sometimes I imagine shapes behind
my head pouring me into wood chips: me alive, me proximate
to want, useful as a body for some animal part unashamed by its own rage.

Why your pouch fit my jaw like that, why you only smell like that after lightning?
Way it sometimes hurts how bad—desire to be bred.
I close a motionless fist, forget to call you by your other name—
small pink flag waving in the wind.

Mime blood all over the floor,
trodden into carpet fibers,
shirts, bras, dried to an airy crust
under my nails. I slit
my neck at the traffic lights,
pow on the train, I suspend
my non-knife above my head,
“see what you’re making me do.”
Red whirls rise from the cuts.
All these huge thoughts come to
nothing. My shadow is
the chalk outline of a woman
who did not jump.

The words that lay a moment on your tongue,
Are one with all that in a moment dies,
A little under-said and over-sung.
But I shall find the sullen rocks and skies
Unchanged from what they were when I was young.

Then said Almitra, Speak to us of Love.      And he raised his head and looked upon the people, and there fell a stillness upon them. And with a great voice he said:      When love beckons to you, follow him,      Though his ways are hard and steep.      And when his wings enfold you yield to him,      Though the sword hidden among his pinions may wound you.      And when he speaks to you believe in him,      Though his voice may shatter your dreams as the north wind lays waste the garden.        For even as love crowns you so shall he crucify you. Even as he is for your growth so is he for your pruning.      Even as he ascends to your height and caresses your tenderest branches that quiver in the sun,      So shall he descend to your roots and shake them in their clinging to the earth.                                        •      Like sheaves of corn he gathers you unto himself.      He threshes you to make you naked.      He sifts you to free you from your husks.      He grinds you to whiteness.      He kneads you until you are pliant;      And then he assigns you to his sacred fire, that you may become sacred bread for God’s sacred feast.        All these things shall love do unto you that you may know the secrets of your heart, and in that knowledge become a fragment of Life’s heart.        But if in your fear you would seek only love’s peace and love’s pleasure,      Then it is better for you that you cover your nakedness and pass out of love’s threshing-floor,      Into the seasonless world where you shall laugh, but not all of your laughter, and weep, but not all of your tears.                                       •      Love gives naught but itself and takes naught but from itself.      Love possesses not nor would it be possessed;      For love is sufficient unto love.        When you love you should not say, “God is in my heart,” but rather, “I am in the heart of God.”      And think not you can direct the course of love, for love, if it finds you worthy, directs your course.        Love has no other desire but to fulfil itself.      But if you love and must needs have desires, let these be your desires:      To melt and be like a running brook that sings its melody to the night.      To know the pain of too much tenderness.      To be wounded by your own under- standing of love;      And to bleed willingly and joyfully.      To wake at dawn with a winged heart and give thanks for another day of loving;      To rest at the noon hour and meditate love’s ecstasy;      To return home at eventide with grati- tude;      And then to sleep with a prayer for the beloved in your heart and a song of praise upon your lips.

When love beckons to you, follow him,
Though his ways are hard and steep.
And when his wings enfold you yield to

For even as love crowns you so shall he
crucify you. Even as he is for your growth
so is he for your pruning.
Even as he ascends to your height and
caresses your tenderest branches that quiver
in the sun,
So shall he descend to your roots and
shake them in their clinging to the earth.
•
Like sheaves of corn he gathers you unto
himself.
He threshes you to make you naked.
He sifts you to free you from your husks.
He grinds you to whiteness.
He kneads you until you are pliant;
And then he assigns you to his sacred
fire, that you may become sacred bread for
God’s sacred feast.

All these things shall love do unto you
that you may know the secrets of your
heart, and in that knowledge become a
fragment of Life’s heart.

But if in your fear you would seek only
love’s peace and love’s pleasure,
Then it is better for you that you cover
your nakedness and pass out of love’s
threshing-floor,
Into the seasonless world where you
shall laugh, but not all of your laughter,
and weep, but not all of your tears.
•
Love gives naught but itself and takes
naught but from itself.
Love possesses not nor would it be
possessed;
For love is sufficient unto love.

When you love you should not say,
“God is in my heart,” but rather, “I am
in the heart of God.”
And think not you can direct the course
of love, for love, if it finds you worthy,
directs your course.

Love has no other desire but to fulfil
itself.
But if you love and must needs have
desires, let these be your desires:
To melt and be like a running brook
that sings its melody to the night.
To know the pain of too much tenderness.
To be wounded by your own under-
standing of love;
And to bleed willingly and joyfully.
To wake at dawn with a winged heart
and give thanks for another day of loving;
To rest at the noon hour and meditate
love’s ecstasy;
To return home at eventide with grati-
tude;
And then to sleep with a prayer for the
beloved in your heart and a song of praise
upon your lips.

a year, came forth and said, Speak to us of
Pleasure.
And he answered, saying:
Pleasure is a freedom-song,
But it is not freedom.
It is the blossoming of your desires,
But it is not their fruit.
It is a depth calling unto a height,
But it is not the deep nor the high.
It is the caged taking wing,
But it is not space encompassed.
Ay, in very truth, pleasure is a freedom-
song.
And I fain would have you sing it with
fullness of heart; yet I would not have you
lose your hearts in the singing.

Some of your youth seek pleasure as if it
were all, and they are judged and rebuked.
I would not judge nor rebuke them. I
would have them seek.
For they shall find pleasure, but not her
alone;
Seven are her sisters, and the least of them
is more beautiful than pleasure.
Have you not heard of the man who was
digging in the earth for roots and found a
treasure?

And some of your elders remember
pleasures with regret like wrongs com-
mitted in drunkenness.
But regret is the beclouding of the mind
and not its chastisement.
They should remember their pleasures with
gratitude, as they would the harvest of a
summer.
Yet if it comforts them to regret, let them
be comforted.

And there are among you those who are
neither young to seek nor old to remember;
And in their fear of seeking and remem-
bering they shun all pleasures, lest they
neglect the spirit or offend against it.
But even in their foregoing is their
pleasure.
And thus they too find a treasure though
they dig for roots with quivering hands.
But tell me, who is he that can offend the
spirit?
Shall the nightingale offend the stillness of
the night, or the firefly the stars?
And shall your flame or your smoke
burden the wind?
Think you the spirit is a still pool which
you can trouble with a staff?

Oftentimes in denying yourself pleasure
you do but store the desire in the recesses
of your being.
Who knows but that which seems omitted
today, waits for tomorrow?
Even your body knows its heritage and
its rightful need and will not be deceived.
And your body is the harp of your soul,
And it is yours to bring forth sweet
music from it or confused sounds.

And now you ask in your heart, “How
shall we distinguish that which is good in
pleasure from that which is not good?”
Go to your fields and your gardens, and
you shall learn that it is the pleasure of
the bee to gather honey of the flower,
But it is also the pleasure of the flower
to yield its honey to the bee.
For to the bee a flower is a fountain of
life,
And to the flower a bee is a messenger of
love,
And to both, bee and flower, the giving
and the receiving of pleasure is a need and
an ecstasy.

People of Orphalese, be in your pleas-
ures like the flowers and the bees.

My mother the queen is dead.
My father the king is old.
He fumbles his cirque of gold
And dreams of a year long fled.
The young men stare at my face,
But cannot meet my glance—
Cavan tall as a lance,
Orra swift in the race.

Death was ever my price,
Since my maidenhood began:
At the thought of a Gaelic man
My heart is sister of ice.
’Tis another for whom I wait,
Though I have not kissed his sword:
He or none is my lord,
Though our night be soon or late.

The star grows great in my breast:
It is crying clearly now
To the star on the burnished prow
Of his galley far in the West.
The capes of the North are dim,
And the windward beaches smoke
Where the last long roller spoke
The tidings it held of him.

Sorrow I know he brings,
Battle, despair and change,—
Beauty cruel and strange,
And the shed bright blood of kings.

Mitzy fell asleep as soon as we got home, but I didn’t. The evening had upset me. Why did Jack keep asking me if I’d been married before? And why did my answer not satisfy him? It was probably just a bad joke. Jack’s humor is off sometimes. But he’s not a bad guy. Well, then I went to bed. When we woke up in the morning Mitzy said, “Jack was right about you, wasn’t he?” “What do you mean?” I said. “Jack said you were kicked out of the Army,” she said. “I was never in the Army, how could I be kicked out?” I said. “I don’t think he likes me.” “Oh, I think Jack likes you a lot. He just wishes you were more interesting,” she said. “And by making me secretly divorced and secretly kicked out of the Army I’m instantly more interesting, is that it?” I said. “According to Jack you are,” she said. “I think we had better have breakfast,” I said. “Good idea,” she said. During breakfast I said, “Don’t you think I’m interesting?” “Of course I do, honey,” she said. “Let’s forget it. I mean, Jack is an old friend. Maybe he was just drunk,” I said. “That’s probably it,” she said. “What are you going to do today?” I asked. “I’m thinking of buying a new dress for the wedding,” she said. “What wedding?” I said. “You know, Carol and Bob’s wedding, next Saturday,” she said. “Oh God, I forgot all about it,” I said. “How could you forget? Bob’s your best friend,” she said. “I know, I just had my mind on other things, but now I’ll focus on their wedding, I promise,” I said. Shortly after that Mitzy left the house. I cleaned up the breakfast dishes, then sat down on the couch. Why had Jack told the two secrets I had told him years ago. I had sworn him to silence, and now everybody knew. I had told him I would kill him if he ever told anybody. I wasn’t going to kill him, but I did think about disappearing, just vanishing altogether. Where would I go? What would I do? And I do love Mitzy. I could tell her the truth. I’ve had eighteen years to do that, and not a squeak so far.

Loren Eiseley



A door opens in the wilderness.
People cross through it—bloused women families

Acquaintances friends all the ones I have loved
Sleep-walkers night-walkers each dazed and shorn—

Street aurous with ice, a snowfall scratched into
Moons—and everything I’d known—

Inside the bleak floating light of my lungs
In the capillaries of my eyes a blood

Glancing through the hatches—
If I said I would always be grateful

If I lied or touched with spite
If night is just a foamline of shadows

Though we were both lost—the door
Opening—the fear of being shown

Whole to the one who must love you still—
And stopped as if on a walk to say

Look at that and what matters what really counts
And I’ll tell you everything if you promise I promise

I stood at door and behind me heard
Snow-plows scrape against roads

At the center of night—unknown to yourself
And the word I said out-loud to no one

That meant it was all to no purpose
The word for the desire inside destruction

For everything that can never be brought back—
Loose snow blown hard to each bank

And the common reel of those who
To avoid one extreme rush toward its opposite—

Snow blasted to piles—and never opened up to
Anything that could reach me until you reached me—

Which hours belonged to us
When was I unknowingly alone

Why did you always return to walk here a path
Behind my closed eyes shedding salt

Dry snowfall and sticks—still were you here
With me I might say The moon rose in the casement window

The red-haired boy across the street has learned to ride his bike
There are still picnics there are fountains

And the world I am leaving behind says
One learns to see one learns to be kind—

I closed my eyes I closed my hands
I shut down the fields in my arms

The cattle on the plains veins ditches
Blue ravines a gray bird

Sailing through a poplar brake kids
Throwing snow I closed the last swinging juncos

Sheep wool caught on barbed wire I closed
Fumes and clear patches of sky I seized

The river the town I shut down
The hard muscles of sleep farmlands

Warming under midnight salt-lights scruff-pines
On the ridge animals scattering across slopes I closed

The smooth bone of evening a storm
On the hills white and noiseless spindled

Prairies where I was born I shut I seized
The clouds I closed in anger—fervor—ardor

i  Kubla Ché, dreaming of ancient Egypt, ate his hyacinths and was marvelous. Wherever you are is what I’m meant to say. Before you beauty come, Dis crouching among the black basalt, kneading master’s soured linen, watching (bewatched) the great beaten gold litter borne by, deltoids sun-dewed stone, temples bronze & strong &     in train     in        thrall perpetual —                                  I am of a mind, daddy. Like, inside the blind-white cloth-of-gold, the scented, sweating box she sat in (think box, lock box) —  Phoenician forest, seeder of  known world’s every known green: malachite, sea-green jasper, chrysocolla, olivine —  & outside, too, other-handed, other- landed, in rainless, treeless Thebes, my dark knees tendered by two lands, rubbed bare by work & love —         Move the tombs to the cliffs of Beni Hasan. Send salt from the four lakes. She is Nefertiti, she shares the crown, she brings the single sun. You do not watch the sun. But in the Deeds of  Suppiluliuma she says she is fearful     but there is no fear past true heresy, her beauty is clear of the next line & the next and that kind of  beauty is     if not redemption the possibility of a separate resurrection.       (Am I not beautiful too?)       The miners are instructed: Find a vein, gouge it to the very end.   ii  Princeling Ché, wolfling Ché, fish- eyed prodigy, anabole, brother mine, all-beautiful boy, who’ll turn your pages now? The lines unfurled before you in your sleep, who sets them to song? I cannot. (All men have crowns and every crown can be broken.)        Were your senses mixed (blood shaking your heart — orange, with violet veins) or did hearing alone stay and go last, were your nostrils, at last, unblocked, your ears, at last, symmetrized, did you unravel first silence    did you dream?        Maimonides says of Abraham it is not God he disobeys but Elohim; that in the bureaucracy of divine instruction the envoy fore the eyes supersedes the voice in the ear     did they close your eyes, daddy?     they must have closed your eyes (enucleate the globe, ligate the four recti, fix in formalin) for under the sole edict of sound                      the son is killed.   iii  Of  your father we dare & do not speak.   iv  Wherever you are, you are not your death. You are not your cold body, your subclavian blood, your spine upon the body block that proffers up your organs, your humors pooled with gravity — you are abed in natron, my friend, you are forty days not in a metal slot but roused into the mirror world, the eastern fields of light, the father sun rayed gentle on the rushes & not the prosector but the jackal keeps your stomach & the falcon your intestines and your heart remains your heart is yours for you there are no more tests of   heart.   v  My friend, magnificent, across your empty desk they go on trading base metals & precious gems. They found flint in feldspar caves, below the first cataract, where single stones, actioned by wind, can mother a dune. They trade tin south to children of  the stars, mix alum with deep-red alizarin to dye, to delight them who are yet to learn the violence of  such charm        heart hanging in its bloodslick chamber     heart gleaming in its rubied darkness                    My husband, my god, my gold-mad son                                                lorn issue, dim & darling eyes flooding with natal sand, every night flooding my free past. What’s a queen know of this     my babies in their sunless cease     what’s a queen’s knees know but milk & crystalled honey     her throat but subtle Mareotic wine     sun smelted to gold, disced & sledding behind her        the whole world’s whole life given her to give —    vi  Look, the dreamer comes!                      Was this what you sleep- conceived, this equal dialogue     this black silt talk rife in death & germ all-mixing, estuarizing, high-banked along the flood’s go-down? (it lowers down its voices, the flood     it helps me to think, blessed ram, of death as flood     for in it all things high & low, fair & dun, flax & inlaid faience, free & liened & husbanded are leveled, meet, and proven in the engorged     the enchafèd delta.)        I see it now. (The trick of death is that it keeps returning.) Lady of all women, they call me, they are all my children now. (Labors of my dim life.) I will prepare each part for them. (From the front, no back     from behind, no face     am I purged at last of the various envies?)        I will build a city for you.       (I will build a city for you.)   vii  Twenty years ago we were nineteen and already elegiac, we were future tensed & annealed, we were quenched in the dark peace of violent histories — Karnak, Babylon, Persepolis, Byzantium — the names alone     (quarry our bones, convey us to Karnak)     our names we preserved, bent to stave & strophe, accomplishing our envy, gathering our violence, we were altogether desire, (only ever) all we would be     full of  imminence     (light first, sun later)     stayed, asituate, unforgiving.   viii  Now you are time’s but I say to you, Ché, in full mouth: We will be perfect. There will be a recognition. The skill has left your fingers, the dream your brainpan but time, too, is prospected by work     (the lumen of the vein)     (the schist afire through the rock) and humans, too, may burn like candles, their spines wicks, their feverdreams the sputting flames —         Work in the shadows. We will work in the shadows, the rest being the madness. Naughty naughty boy. Ward residuum. Hold to murmur, hold to method. You see? Time breaks along its faults, lays bare its jeweled fragments for those who love and work. It gives it all for free. It asks only reversion at the end. (And like, that end whereof we could not think     thereof  (no questions asked) you spake & said, My father     and you answered, Here am I, my son)     O tell me — go, you go first (you went first) — what reason makes this right, what insupposable value, what excuse but ultimacy which all know to be the breath of evil?        I will build a city for you.   ix  About beauty they really got it, those masters: great wonders call for great suffering. The father straps down his son, carves along the throat’s chalked crease (signaling purpose), the slavers slough off infants into sand holes (streamlining, focusing the workforce), the queen conceives eternal city, she deracinates a people to upraise it with their bowed backs, mortar it with their warm, oxygenated blood     sunk generations & contingency & opportunity cost     gambling our own lives’ great gamble: that wrong, actioned by time, can be made soluble in art.                                             So, Volchénochëk, you may be absolved —  I tried & trying.   x  Listen, I want to say something to you. You arrived just in time. You told me they’re not better than us, you honored our sin, repaired my will, you were havoc in the trees, the dense infolding fire & its fuel at once (white fusion, wild usufruct)     always your mind was the Emergency, always severaled, chording the upper & lower, equal & bonded in appetency, bonded always to mine.        This is a moment of children. Who cares who sees? (Who sees?) We scoff at faultless entropy, we strip the pith from the inner stalk, we count to three. Talk me into it, daddy (the first rolls were blank)     oxidize this carbon black significance — heart of water — this red hematite & blue frit, these yellow ochres that every child knows enflesh the unreal sun —    xi  Put it another way: the ink gleams for three more words before it (and meaning) sets. In those three beats I must be thousand-faced, entelechied, liable, I must be totally told on —         in the middle of my life a myth, a tidal mouth, I am planted in bitter celery, in the phytolithic matrix     all-possible clay     I sense your slow impulsion all around me.        Heart’s lake, calendula on my fingers, laughter in the morning- golded reeds (shaking the papyrus), the scale in the wind that shakes the reeds, deus absconditus, the only gossip of the living, I miss you so much.   xii  Either we are eternal, with neither end nor beginning, or we are sprung from a single thing and proliferative — in either case death is not death (though time cannot but give form to suffering). Believe (if you must) as I must:        In all things moment.        In each thing everything.

Kubla Ché, dreaming of ancient
Egypt, ate his hyacinths and was
marvelous. Wherever you are is
what I’m meant to say. Before you
beauty come, Dis crouching among
the black basalt, kneading master’s
soured linen, watching (bewatched)
the great beaten gold litter borne by,
deltoids sun-dewed stone, temples
bronze & strong &     in train     in
thrall perpetual —
I am of a mind,
daddy. Like, inside the blind-white
cloth-of-gold, the scented, sweating
box she sat in (think box, lock box) —
Phoenician forest, seeder of  known
world’s every known green: malachite,
sea-green jasper, chrysocolla, olivine —
& outside, too, other-handed, other-
landed, in rainless, treeless Thebes, my
dark knees tendered by two lands, rubbed
bare by work & love —
Move the tombs to the cliffs of
Beni Hasan. Send salt from the four
lakes. She is Nefertiti, she shares
the crown, she brings the single sun.
You do not watch the sun. But in
the Deeds of  Suppiluliuma she
says she is fearful     but there is no
fear past true heresy, her beauty is
clear of the next line & the next and
that kind of  beauty is     if not
redemption the possibility of a
separate resurrection.
(Am I not beautiful too?)
The miners are instructed: Find a
vein, gouge it to the very end.
ii
ii
Princeling Ché, wolfling Ché, fish-
eyed prodigy, anabole, brother
mine, all-beautiful boy, who’ll turn
your pages now? The lines unfurled
before you in your sleep, who sets
them to song? I cannot. (All men
have crowns and every crown can be
broken.)
Were your senses mixed (blood
shaking your heart — orange, with
violet veins) or did hearing alone
stay and go last, were your nostrils,
at last, unblocked, your ears, at last,
symmetrized, did you unravel
first silence    did you dream?
Maimonides says of Abraham
it is not God he disobeys but
Elohim; that in the bureaucracy
of divine instruction the envoy
fore the eyes supersedes the voice
in the ear     did they close your
eyes, daddy?     they must have
closed your eyes (enucleate the
globe, ligate the four recti, fix in
formalin) for under the sole edict
of sound
the son is killed.
iii

Of  your father we dare & do
not speak.

Wherever you are, you are not
your death. You are not your cold
body, your subclavian blood, your
spine upon the body block that
proffers up your organs, your
humors pooled with gravity — you
are abed in natron, my friend, you are
forty days not in a metal slot but
roused into the mirror world, the
eastern fields of light, the father
sun rayed gentle on the rushes &
not the prosector but the jackal
keeps your stomach & the falcon
your intestines and your heart
remains your heart is yours for you
there are no more tests of   heart.
v

My friend, magnificent, across your
empty desk they go on trading base
metals & precious gems. They found
flint in feldspar caves, below the first
cataract, where single stones, actioned
by wind, can mother a dune. They trade
tin south to children of  the stars, mix
alum with deep-red alizarin to
dye, to delight them who are yet to
learn the violence of  such charm
heart hanging in its bloodslick
chamber     heart gleaming in its
rubied darkness
My husband, my god,
my gold-mad son
lorn
issue, dim & darling eyes flooding
with natal sand, every night flooding
my free past. What’s a queen know
of this     my babies in their sunless
cease     what’s a queen’s knees know
but milk & crystalled honey     her
throat but subtle Mareotic wine     sun
smelted to gold, disced & sledding
behind her
the whole world’s whole life
given her to give —
vi

Look, the dreamer comes!
Was this what you sleep-
conceived, this equal dialogue     this
black silt talk rife in death & germ
all-mixing, estuarizing, high-banked
along the flood’s go-down? (it
lowers down its voices, the flood     it
helps me to think, blessed ram, of
death as flood     for in it all
things high & low, fair & dun, flax
& inlaid faience, free & liened &
husbanded are leveled, meet, and
proven in the engorged     the
enchafèd delta.)
I see it now. (The trick of death
is that it keeps returning.) Lady of
all women, they call me, they are
all my children now. (Labors of
my dim life.) I will prepare each
part for them. (From the front, no
back     from behind, no face     am
I purged at last of the various
envies?)
I will build a city for you.
(I will build a city for you.)
vii
vii
Twenty years ago we were nineteen
and already elegiac, we were
future tensed & annealed, we were
quenched in the dark peace of
violent histories — Karnak, Babylon,
Persepolis, Byzantium — the names
alone     (quarry our bones, convey
us to Karnak)     our names we
preserved, bent to stave & strophe,
accomplishing our envy, gathering
our violence, we were altogether
desire, (only ever) all we would
be     full of  imminence     (light
first, sun later)     stayed, asituate,
unforgiving.
viii
viii
Now you are time’s but I say to you,
Ché, in full mouth: We will be perfect.
There will be a recognition. The skill
has left your fingers, the dream your
brainpan but time, too, is prospected by
work     (the lumen of the vein)     (the
schist afire through the rock) and humans,
too, may burn like candles, their spines
wicks, their feverdreams the sputting
flames —
Work in the shadows. We will work
in the shadows, the rest being the
madness. Naughty naughty boy. Ward
residuum. Hold to murmur, hold
to method. You see? Time breaks along
its faults, lays bare its jeweled fragments
for those who love and work. It gives
it all for free. It asks only reversion
at the end. (And like, that end whereof
we could not think     thereof  (no
questions asked) you spake & said, My
father     and you answered, Here am I,
my son)     O tell me — go, you go
first (you went first) — what reason
makes this right, what insupposable
value, what excuse but ultimacy which
all know to be the breath of evil?

I will build a city for you.

About beauty they really got it, those
masters: great wonders call for great
suffering. The father straps down
his son, carves along the throat’s chalked
crease (signaling purpose), the slavers
slough off infants into sand holes
(streamlining, focusing the workforce),
the queen conceives eternal city, she
deracinates a people to upraise it
with their bowed backs, mortar it with
their warm, oxygenated blood     sunk
generations & contingency &
opportunity cost     gambling our
own lives’ great gamble: that wrong,
actioned by time, can be made
soluble in art.
So,
Volchénochëk, you may be absolved —
I tried & trying.

Listen, I want to say something to you.
You arrived just in time. You told me
they’re not better than us, you honored
our sin, repaired my will, you were
havoc in the trees, the dense infolding
fire & its fuel at once (white fusion,
wild usufruct)     always your mind
was the Emergency, always severaled,
chording the upper & lower, equal
& bonded in appetency, bonded
always to mine.
This is a moment of children.
Who cares who sees? (Who sees?) We
scoff at faultless entropy, we strip the
pith from the inner stalk, we count to
three. Talk me into it, daddy (the
first rolls were blank)     oxidize
this carbon black significance — heart
of water — this red hematite & blue
frit, these yellow ochres that every
child knows enflesh the unreal
sun —
xi
xi
Put it another way: the ink gleams
for three more words before it (and
meaning) sets. In those three beats I
must be thousand-faced, entelechied,
liable, I must be totally told on —
in the middle of my life
a myth, a tidal mouth, I am planted
in bitter celery, in the phytolithic
matrix     all-possible clay     I sense
your slow impulsion all around me.
Heart’s lake, calendula on my
fingers, laughter in the morning-
golded reeds (shaking the papyrus),
the scale in the wind that shakes
the reeds, deus absconditus, the only
gossip of the living, I miss you
so much.
xii
xii
Either we are eternal, with neither
end nor beginning, or we are
sprung from a single thing and
proliferative — in either case death
is not death (though time cannot but

(if you must) as I must:

In all things moment.

Whenever folks discuss finding themselves, ya get kinda giggly. Maybe b/c ya found yrself considering yr Armenian love who preferred ya in both corset and bindi, and it was for her ya begrudgingly waxed yr jungle-scabbard    ...    Ya find yrself in the fret of reclamation via musks all motherland-misty (coconut milk, marine accord, mimosa tree). Last weekend, ya found yrself in leggings to argue again with yr Dominican love over the tender texture of Texas tamales. Ya not-so-secretly want to find yrself in a garden kissing a risk- taking party until ya feel as good as a half-price smoothie. Somehow, identity never finds ya kohl-eyed in magenta blooms photographed by a mixed-race admirer on a humid evening, mostly b/c yr too busy galaxy-gazing to be anyone’s so-fair-and-lovely. Was that a touch of pride or self-pity? Probably. But ya just can’t deal with another stranger’s surprise at yr love of both tequila and mango lassis. Does yr Guyanese love truly expect ya to replace the chicken & fish in yr diet with mushrooms that arbitrarily? You’re so black, yr told pretty frequently. Ya don’t know what to make of it: humanity. Ever find yrself advised by Bangladeshi Brooklynites? Like they know yr bae Poetry! Loves, let’s stop projecting insecurities. But maybe it’s like when ya tried to be cheerful after a famous poet called ya Debbie Downer for mentioning the hurricanes in yr other sovereignty? Never don’t find yrself coring what music can be cleaved from a dull language into an anomalous nationality. A personal theory: we all behave oddly around fat titties. Now here Poetry comes to say she wants to be an ode to what is muddy. OK, baby. Here’s to dank difficult borders, gardens of ingrown perennials, fractured fins, the wings of inner menageries.

I place a photograph of my uncle on my computer desktop, which means I learn to ignore it. He stands by a tank, helmet tilting to his right, bootlaces tightened as if stitching together a wound. Alive the hand brings up a cigarette we won't see him taste. Last night I smoked one on the steps outside my barn apartment. A promise I broke myself. He promised himself he wouldn't and did. I smell my fingers and I am smelling his. Hands of smoke and gunpowder. Hands that promised they wouldn't, but did.  This album is a stop-loss. By a dim lantern or in the latrine he flips through it. He looks at himself looking nearly as he does— closest to himself then as he could be, just learning how to lean into his new body. He suspends there by standing order, a spreading fire in his chest, his groin. He is on stage for us to see him, see him? He stands in the noontime sun.   A young soldier (pictured above) the son of an imam, brother to six, is among the latest casualties in the military campaign of Susangerd.    your whole body in a photo your whole body sitting on a crate pressing your eyesocket to the viewfinder of a bazooka crouched as you balance the metal tube on your shoulder in one you guide a belt of ammo into the untiring weapon proud your elbow out as if mid-waltz your frame strong and lightly supporting the gun a kind of smile ruining the picture  You’re posing. You’re scared. A body falls and you learn to step over a loosened head. You begin to appreciate the heft of your boot soles, how they propel you, how they can kick in a face– the collapse of a canopy bed in an aerial bombardment, mosquito netting doused in napalm–cheekbones fragile as moth wings beneath the heel. You tighten your laces until they hold together a capable man. Whatever rains, the weight of your feet swings you forward, goose-stepping pendulums a body less and less yours– a body, God knows, is not what makes you anyway. So the hands that said they never would begin finding grenade pins around their fingers, begin flipping through this album with soot under their nails you were not ready But they issued the shovel and the rifle and you dug But to watch you sitting there between the sandbags But to watch the sand spilling out the bullet holes But what did they expect But what did they really think a sheet of metal could prevent But I sat rolling little ears of pasta off my thumb like helmets But it was not a table of fallen men But my hand registered fatigue But the men in fatigues were tired of sleeping in shifts But you snuck into town and dialed home until you wrote your fingers        were tired But the code for Shiraz was down But all of Shiraz was down But the sheet lightning above the Ferris wheel of rusted bolts But I am sure they are alright you wrote Well to reassure yourself But the wind like an old mouth shaking the unnamed evergreen outside        my window But what I mean is I'd like very much to talk a bitHello    Operation Ramadan was an offensive in the Iran-Iraq War. It was launched by Iran in July 1982 near Basra and featured the use of human wave attacks in one of the largest land battles since World War II. Aftermath: The operation was the first of many disastrous offensives which cost thousands of lives on both sides. This one in general boosted the casualty limit up to 80,000 killed, 200,000 wounded, and 45,000 captured. In retrospect, the Iranians lacked effective command and control, air support, and logistics to sustain an attack in the first place. Saddam Hussein offered several ceasefire attempts in the following year, none of which were accepted by the Revolutionary regime. [6] [dead link]    Congratulations and condolences They would sayThat's the house of a martyr pointing with their noseThat's the mother of a martyr They are building a museum for the martyrs. Some metal shelf a white archival box with his personal effects. I am attempting my own myth-making.He didn’t want to have  anythingto do with it.  White-shrouded, they circled his corpse, the ridge of his nose peaking the sheet or shaded by the boxlid, around Shah Cheragh. Daily I sit with the language they've made of our language to neutralize the capability of low dollar value items like you. You are what is referred to as a ""casualty.""

Bye for real this time you signed off on page 6. His father grew very quiet His father wouldheavy drop sob behind a closed door His father wasperson eligible to receive effects A pillbox of opium in his sock drawer   you hand plucked wild poppies to soldier friends imagine the wetness at the broken stem me and two girls at a Birmingham back fence clearing almost an entire vine of honeysuckles that sugar tasting vaguely of grass carnage of petals and pistils licked clean at our little bee feet  What I see are your hands peeling apples, the skin curling to the floor in one long unravel, a spit-up film reel loosened from its canister, and I'm not even sure they are apples, quince, pear, some desert potato with a stem. From the number of peels I assume you are feeding the other men in your tent. Your head is down. Maybe the cameraman asked you to look at him and you couldn't stomach it. Maybe around you, today, they fell until you didn't understand how you hadn't been hit. I decide you are happy for the knife in your hands, the white dust on your bare feet. I am happy to see your bare feet in this photo. They are the only things that made me cry. It's that they existed and that they, appalling, look so dead already. I think it's fair to say you want to do something with your hands, whether or not the photographer placed the apples in front of you whether or not they are apples, whether or not earlier that day you saw a friend's lungs peeking out the back of his throat. I cannot name the weapons leaning on the wall behind you–Kalashnikovs? Howitzers?—as you write a letter. I wroteI burn my finger on the broiler and smell trenches, my uncle pissing himself. ""How can she write that? She doesn't know,"" a friend, a daughter of a Vietnam vet, told another friend, another daughter of a Vietnam vet.   it was his bare toes that made me cry because I realized then he had toes and because dusted in the white desert sand they looked like a corpse's toes while his hands worked off a peel inches above the earth     Operation Nasr, fought in early January 1981, was a major battle of the Iran-Iraq War. Three Iranian armored regiments advanced towards Iraqi forces who had invaded Iranian territory between the cities of Ahvaz, Susangerd, and Dezful. The Iraqi forces were alerted to this movement and feigned a withdrawal. The Iraqis formed three armored regiments into a three-sided box ambush. The Iranians blundered into the ambush and the two tank forces battled for four days in a sea of mud. The battle had been ordered by President Abdulhassan Banisadr who was hoping that a victory might shore up his deteriorating political position; instead the failure of the offensive helped to hasten his fall. [26]    I write him daily And so I learn to ignore him And so I begin to list pocket contents as if filing an autopsy report And I place in his hands a metal tongue of a fly And I place in his hands a metal tongue of a tank control board And I place in his hands a Bic lighter and loose leaf paper And I place in his hands a trigger, a shutter And still not even a bar of his laughter And by April the script in his letters grew tighter, barbed, men in a shoulder-       width trench And when I sounded out M-EE-N to mean mine a hole appeared in the letter        and I couldn’t look at it And I drove into pothole after pothole And I drove past a hundred balloons held down in a net And gone even the netting over his helmet And alive we bring up the hands to hold together his neck And I place in his hands his head And I place in his hands my hands And I place in his eyes a look we share in the rearview And I place between us a bar of laughter And I place between us the looking and the telling they want dead Amoo, In a tarot card reading A asks ""Are you open to love? Are you keeping love in mind?"" Amoo, I think. Amoo. The word a moan a blown kiss the soft things it makes a mouth do. Amoo, I thought as he told me about the Page of Cups, the echo of what I've never called you.Hello you'd approach in the international terminal. I'd be disheveled from the search, raw.Hello. Do you know who I am? Amoo Javad I'd say. The things a mouth wishes to Amoo jan or Amoo Javad or Amoo joon JavadJanam you would respond—My life, my soul, you'd say— Language and its expectations teaches us about the relationship we would have had.Na kheyr, for example— that we need words for refusal makes it likely we would refuse things of each other. Or Baleh. As in you sayDo you know who I am and I respond, though you could be a number of brothers from our albums,Yes.  I wroteI burn my finger on the broiler and smell trenches, my uncle pissing himself. How can she write that? She doesn't know. As if a film projection caught in theater dust, I play it out: I approach you in the new Imam Khomeini Airport, fluorescent-lit linoleum, you walk up to meet me, both palms behind your back like a haji. You stoop, extend a handHello. Do you know who I am?Yes, I tell you, I half-lie,Yes. An address, beloved lit a rooftop of doves             crouched to launchYes, Amoo. How could I not?

I place a photograph of my uncle on my computer desktop, which means I learn to ignore it. He stands by a tank, helmet tilting to his right, bootlaces tightened as if stitching together a wound. Alive the hand brings up a cigarette we won't see him taste. Last night I smoked one on the steps outside my barn apartment. A promise I broke myself. He promised himself he wouldn't and did. I smell my fingers and I am smelling his. Hands of smoke and gunpowder. Hands that promised they wouldn't, but did.

This album is a stop-loss. By a dim lantern
or in the latrine
he flips through it.
He looks at himself
looking nearly as he does—
closest to himself then
as he could be, just learning
how to lean into his new body.
He suspends there
by standing order,
a spreading fire in his chest,
his groin. He is on stage
for us to see him, see him?
He stands in the noontime sun.

your whole body in a photo
your whole body
sitting on a crate
pressing your eyesocket
to the viewfinder
of a bazooka
crouched as you balance
the metal tube on your shoulder
in one you guide a belt of ammo
into the untiring weapon
proud
your elbow out as if
mid-waltz
your frame strong
and lightly supporting the gun
a kind of smile
ruining the picture










You’re posing. You’re scared.
A body falls
and you learn to step over

a loosened head. You begin to appreciate
the heft of your boot soles,
how they propel you,

how they can kick in
a face–
the collapse

of a canopy bed
in an aerial bombardment,
mosquito netting doused

in napalm–cheekbones fragile
as moth wings beneath the heel.
You tighten your laces

until they hold together
a capable man.
Whatever rains,

the weight of your feet
swings you forward,
goose-stepping pendulums

a body less and less yours–
a body, God knows,
is not what makes you

anyway. So the hands
that said they never would
begin finding

grenade pins around their fingers,
begin flipping through this album
with soot under their nails






you were not ready
But they issued the shovel and the rifle and you dug
But to watch you sitting there between the sandbags
But to watch the sand spilling out the bullet holes
But what did they expect
But what did they really think a sheet of metal could prevent
But I sat rolling little ears of pasta off my thumb like helmets
But it was not a table of fallen men
But my hand registered fatigue
But the men in fatigues were tired of sleeping in shifts
But you snuck into town and dialed home until you wrote your fingers
were tired
But the code for Shiraz was down
But all of Shiraz was down
But the sheet lightning above the Ferris wheel of rusted bolts
But I am sure they are alright you wrote Well to reassure yourself
But the wind like an old mouth shaking the unnamed evergreen outside
my window
But what I mean is I'd like very much to talk a bit

Hello










Operation Ramadan was an offensive in the Iran-Iraq War. It was launched by Iran in July 1982 near Basra and featured the use of human wave attacks in one of the largest land battles since World War II. Aftermath: The operation was the first of many disastrous offensives which cost thousands of lives on both sides. This one in general boosted the casualty limit up to 80,000 killed, 200,000 wounded, and 45,000 captured. In retrospect, the Iranians lacked effective command and control, air support, and logistics to sustain an attack in the first place. Saddam Hussein offered several ceasefire attempts in the following year, none of which were accepted by the Revolutionary regime. [6] [dead link]

Congratulations and condolences

They would say
That's the house of a martyr
pointing with their nose
That's the mother of a martyr

They are building a museum
for the martyrs.
Some metal shelf
a white archival box

with his personal effects.

I am attempting my own

myth-making.
He didn’t want to have
anything

to do with it.
White-shrouded, they circled

his corpse, the ridge of his nose
peaking the sheet
or shaded by the boxlid,
around Shah Cheragh.






Daily I sit
with the language
they've made

of our language

to neutralize
the capability of low dollar value items
like you.

You are what is referred to as
a ""casualty."" Unclear whether
from a catalytic or frontal attack, unclear

the final time you were addressed

thou, beloved. It was for us a
catastrophic event.

Just, destroyed.

died of wounds received in action.

Yes, there was
early warning.
You said you were especially scared
of mortar rounds.

In execution planning, they weighed
the losses, the sustainability
and budgeted

for X number,
they budgeted for the phone call
to your mother and weighed that

against the amount saved in rations
and your taste for cigarettes

and the tea you poured your boys
and the tea you would’ve poured me
approaching Hello.

The change you collected in jars
jumping a bit
as the family learns to slam
the home's various doors.











How could she say
the things she does not
know. A poison

tipped arrow, she told
classmates at recess,
to the neck, hollow whistle

of it launched
from a blowgun
cutting the air between them.

According to most
definitions, I have never
been at war.

According to mine,
most of my life
spent there. Anthrax

in salt and pepper shakers,
patrol car windshields
with crosshairs painted over them,

some badge holding
my father's pocket contents
up to him and asking

where the cash is from.
The war in Iraq, I read,
is over now.

The last wheels gathering
into themselves
as they lift off

the sad tarmac. I say
begin. I say end
and you are to believe

this is what happens.
I say chew 40 times
before swallowing, slime,

and you go home to mother,
press a dog tag to your temple,
press a gun to that,

the tag flowering
into your skull. Thank God
for all-weather floor mats

and the slope of my personal driveway
and beer cans that change
color to let me know

they are cold enough.
The full-sized cab
smelling of iron and Axe body spray.

In 2003, a man held a fistful
of blood and brains to a PBS camera
and yelled

is this the freedom
they want for us? It was from his friend's
head. They were marching

as they figured Americans do.
Between them, hardly three horsepower
and still we shot him.

We say the war is over, but still
the woman leans across
the passenger seat

my son, my son.
I wasn't there
so I can't know, can I?






His mother's bed.
A grief we don't attempt to console.

I killed him she'll tell me
years later. Fuck

celestial guidance

I killed him she'll say
in the midst of civil affairs

he surprises, he arrives,
eyes taped shut, torso held together
by black thread, fridge-cold—

grief is a closed area
cluttered with his fork against the plate
and other forgotten musics.

The enlarged ID photo above her mantel
means I can know Amoo,
my dear collateral damage,

as only a state or a school might do.





each photo is an absence, a thing gone, namely a moment, sometimes cities, a tour boat balanced on a two-story home miles from shore
each photo is an absence,
a thing gone, namely
a moment, sometimes cities,
a tour boat balanced

He was, we hope, moved.
Moved, but we will have to guess by what:

• shampoo in her wet hair
• salty and fried breads
• the chase scene in Bullitt
• sangak fresh from the oven dampening the newspaper on the walk home
from the baker's
• the arms of someone who smells nice to him in the morning
• the mouth of someone laced with bergamot or cardamom, who dances
in the kitchen and lets whatever's on the stove burn. Who burns for
him.

and beside him they burned,

they boiled, they fell,
shortly after a loud sound
that makes him piss himself.

• being nice to others
• loose change
• chess. He could beat all the brothers in chess.

He was moved like that
across a minefield—
moved by a hand we cannot see,

a hand that is all our hands combined.

Or as I gleaned from your letters:

-
-
would, in Mashhad,

-
-
and my own broken Farsi.

-
-
freefall

then radio silence. An order

to disarm. Stay.

tried to disarm, tried

sorry. For this, I

By the time you

asking to bring you a camera,

an automatic please.






I search the cities where you were stationed

a ring of schoolboys
laid out on the plastic tarp
their crooked joints

a middle-aged man with
ground meat

where his foot used to be.
I looked
to see if I could find you

netting over your helmet.

In one letter,
you name the seventh killed
in your company

Well maybe I am next.
You didn't say much else

But it must have

To record the one name

A pillbox of opium

you hand
plucked wild poppies
to soldier friends
imagine the wetness
at the broken stem
me and two girls
at a Birmingham back fence
clearing almost
an entire vine of honeysuckles
that sugar
tasting vaguely of grass
carnage of petals
and pistils licked clean

What I see are your hands
peeling apples, the skin curling
to the floor in one long unravel,

a spit-up film reel
loosened from its canister, and
I'm not even sure they are apples, quince,

pear, some desert potato with a stem.
From the number of peels
I assume you are feeding

the other men in your tent.
Your head is down.
Maybe the cameraman

asked you to look at him
and you couldn't stomach
it. Maybe around you,

today, they fell until
you didn't understand
how you hadn't

been hit.
I decide you are happy
for the knife

in your hands,
the white dust
on your bare feet. I am happy

to see your bare feet
in this photo. They are
the only things that

made me cry. It's that
they existed
and that they, appalling,

look so dead already.
I think it's fair to say
you want to do something

with your hands, whether
or not the photographer
placed the apples in front of you

whether or not they are
apples, whether or not
earlier that day you saw

a friend's lungs peeking
out the back of his throat.
I cannot name

the weapons leaning
on the wall behind you–Kalashnikovs?
Howitzers?—as you write

a letter. I wrote
I burn my finger on the broiler
and smell trenches, my uncle

pissing himself. ""How can she write that?
She doesn't know,"" a friend, a daughter
of a Vietnam vet, told another friend,

another daughter of a Vietnam vet.

I write him daily
And so I learn to ignore him
And so I begin to list pocket contents as if filing an autopsy report
And I place in his hands a metal tongue of a fly
And I place in his hands a metal tongue of a tank control board
And I place in his hands a Bic lighter and loose leaf paper
And I place in his hands a trigger, a shutter
And still not even a bar of his laughter
And by April the script in his letters grew tighter, barbed, men in a shoulder-
width trench
And when I sounded out M-EE-N to mean mine a hole appeared in the letter
and I couldn’t look at it
And I drove into pothole after pothole
And I drove past a hundred balloons held down in a net
And gone even the netting over his helmet
And alive we bring up the hands to hold together his neck
And I place in his hands his head
And I place in his hands my hands
And I place in his eyes a look we share in the rearview
And I place between us a bar of laughter
And I place between us the looking and the telling they want dead






Amoo,

In a tarot card reading
A asks ""Are you open
to love? Are you keeping love in mind?""

Amoo, I think.
Amoo.
The word a moan

a blown kiss
the soft things it makes a mouth do.
Amoo, I thought

as he told me about the Page of Cups,
the echo of what
I've never called you.

Hello you'd approach
in the international terminal.
I'd be disheveled

from the search, raw.
Hello. Do you know who I am?
Amoo Javad I'd say.

The things a mouth wishes to

Janam you would respond—
My life, my soul, you'd say—

Language and its expectations
teaches us
about the relationship

we would have had.
Na kheyr, for example—
that we need words

for refusal makes it likely
we would refuse things
of each other.

Or Baleh. As in you say
Do you know who I am
and I respond,

though you could be a number of brothers
from our albums,
Yes.






I wrote
I burn my finger on the broiler
and smell trenches, my uncle

pissing himself. How can she write that?
She doesn't know.

As if a film projection caught
in theater dust, I play it

out: I approach you

in the new Imam Khomeini Airport,

fluorescent-lit linoleum, you walk up
to meet me, both palms
behind your back
like a haji. You stoop, extend a hand

Hello. Do you know who I am?

Yes, I tell you, I half-lie,
Yes. An address, beloved
lit
a rooftop of doves

crouched to launch
Yes, Amoo.

How could I not?

You leave me sleeping in the dark. You kiss me and I stir, fingers in your hair, eyes open, unseeing. You leave me asleep every morning, commuting to the school in the city at sunrise. The landlord’s driveway, a muddy creek, ices over hard after the freezing rain clatters all night. Your feet fly up, your head slamming the ground, an eclipse of the sun flooding your eyes. You sleep under the car. No one knows how long you sleep. You awake with a hundred ice picks stabbing your eardrums. You awake, coat and hair soaked, and somehow drive to school. You remember to turn left at the Smith & Wesson factory. The other teachers lead you by the elbow to Mercy Hospital, where you pause when the nurse asks your name, where you claim your pain level is a four, and they slide you into the white coffin of an MRI machine. You hold your breath. They film your brain.Concussion: the word we use for the boxer plunging face-first to the canvas after the uppercut blindsided him, not the teacher commuting to school at sunrise in a Subaru Crosstrek. Yet, you would drive, ears hammering as they hammer in the purgatory of the MRI. A week before, Isabela came to you in the classroom and said:Miss, I cannot sleep. Three days, I cannot sleep. Her boyfriend called at 2 am, and she did not pick up. At 3 am, a single shot to the head put him to sleep, and he will sleep forever, his body hidden beneath a car in a parking lot on Maple Street, the cops, the television cameras, the neighbors all gathering at the yellow-tape carnival of his corpse. You said to Isabela: Take this journal. Write it down. You don’t haveto show me. You don’t have to show anyone. On the cover of the journal you bought at the drugstore was the word: Dream. Isabela sat there in your classroom, at your desk, pencil waving in furious circles. By lunchtime, as her friends slapped each other, Isabela slept, head on the desk, face pressed against the pages of the journal. This is why I watch you sleep at 3 am, when the sleeping pills fail to quell the strike meeting in my brain. This is why I say to you, when you kiss me in my sleep: Don’t go. Don’t go. You have to go.

A black sun rises in the West of me
& will never set. God of my fathers, sleep
like the one sleeping next to me;
inert & tenderly coiled. I am so grateful
to yóu, that breathes as the dead
breathe in their shallow land — barely,
below the range of my hearing.
That draws in the thin streams of black air
& shifts & puts a white arm around me.
I want to know, Né, what it is like
in the kingdom of the dead where you are.
Is the one I fear there with her train
of silver hair? Have you seen John, the temples
of his glasses duct-taped to the hinge?
I know it is not still there; I know everything
is in furious motion beneath
the black sun & the sky white as chalk —
the torrent of silver hair whipped
about her face that woke in the moonlight
on the last morning, lucid & fluent,
& turned toward my father & said, “I love you,”
walking backward on the white road
into the white sky toward the white city,
black sun clearing the horizon &
a wind lifting in the torn leaves like the wind
in the wood above Lady’s Walk
where I trespassed in spring, singing,
Sigh no more, ladies, sigh no more, the bluebells
hissing like cats & the canopy
a violent array, violently outside me
in flickering Islamic greens / Spanish grays,
the topside / bellyside of milled
leaves, the harebells biting their bitter tongues,
& raising its head in panic, a juvenile
fallow deer stippled with thick white spots.
Then someone shouted, “Oy, stay there, you fúck,”
Oyé, Whale, & my launces in his side,
& I went down the hill with the sweetgrass
pulling at me & the spit in my mouth.
Né, I cannot sleep. Ever since I lost my little children.
I look for their shapes on the ceiling,
in the dark, & they are not there.
Né, never, no, no, never, never, never, never.
There is nothing, Né. Neither the night
nor the white city like Conholt in its great estate.
Not the hart, nor the furious wood.
O,           John, John. I came downstairs still drunk
to find you asleep with your head
on the hoover, & the hoover still running;
half-shaved, the tape on your glasses,
your mouth open & the tattered Crombie.
Then years later when Oli called & you were,
O John. Y am alpha and oo, the firste
and the laste, bigynnyng and ende.
O,           John, John. No white city as a wijf ourned to hir hosebonde,
no voice in the wind, in the (clouds) crying
Lo! Y make alle thingis newe. I make all things new.
Como una novia adornada para su esposo.
Como tu cuerpo en la noche, Né; like this body
that pregnancies have raged over
& I have loved with my mouth moost feithful and trewe.
i              And let him that is athirst come.
ii             And let him that heareth say, Come.
iii            And let the dawn thunder up in the street
while you are sleeping with the first cars sauntering
by & the dustmen & women whistling.
Lord, I will stand before yóu when yóu wish
in death’s little house & yóu will eat my pronoun.
•
•
In that other life that will be ours
where there is neither marriage nor children,
I may kneel beside you, Mouse, & not
know you — our eyes like a golem’s, empty
of their own will, but full of hís,
the dead Lord at the center of hís dead city.
In the days when my glory is stripped
from me, & yours from you, & all are made
equal — no aesthetic splendor, no charm,
no subversive, faithless glances to-
ward those I have loved & have loved me;
no property, no desire, no variation,
no sparrowhawk thrusting through birches
in the snow toward the wood, for
hé never stepped in a wood, nor saw a harebell
easing its frail metaled head, its light
pinks & papery blues, through the first tranche
of snow in November, nor the gray cere
of the plunderer beneath her blue helmet,
her single attention, wings volute in air,
head w/ beak narrowly ajar in concentration
& hunger breaking the line of the fence
at the old house in Broadway;
in the snow; in the snow that has flattened
everything, the bells ringing out,
the clouds heaped above the Blackdowns
dragging themselves from the earth,
headlights on the ridge in the wind groping
toward them, the hills featureless,
snuffed, white, black, dull, shining w/ no light.
No drinking in the afternoon, no dope,
no flaring temper. No bed to sleep
it off, Mouse, while you draw catkins & piggies
& pussybears with gorgeous happy frowns
in the cold. No sleep, no flesh to rest
in, for there is only day in the white irradiate
city where the lamb lights hís terrible
mercy in to worldis of worldis, forever & ever
& hís government will never fail, for no glory
is allowed but hís glory, no bone
gouvernance but hís bone gouvernance,
no prison camp but hís prison camp,
hís plantations, hís will & techne, hís punishment
beatings, hís censorship, hís textual criticism,
hís forgiveness, hís rehabilitation, O
ferdful men, & vnbileueful & cursid & manquelleris.
Mouse, on that day, will you turn toward me
& will I see in the insubstantial glass
of your eyes the memory of these days;
myself, father, authority, half chocolate & half
steel, still carrying you at six up the hill
& down the hill, still playing the Ticklepuss
& Crocopotamus, the horn of plenty,
salver, lessener of cries, bringer of swallows
& dragonflies, the Emperor & Downy Emerald
hovering over still waters in the valei of teeris,
wolves in the mist in the hills
above Antequera where the rocks bared
themselves like teeth & you were
asleep on my chest with fine alabaster
eyelids & eyelashes plashed with droplets of dew?
Where I said, “Shhhhhh, close your eyes
& imagine that you’re a water reed, Mouse,”
& I blew on you & that was the wind
& then my hand was a snail wandering over
your eyelids & the nape of your neck
& last of all it rained & that was my fingers
going pitter-pat upon the pinnacles of your head.
The days fade through our slow parting;
your mother grows ambivalent. Little accident,
in the stillness of the earth there is no life;
the harebell reaches its root into death
& the waters flow down until the rock is dry.
I wanted more than I was given,
& found in betrayal a churning courage.
Torchlight in the garden where we make our choice.
The will that flickers. My loss. Our bliss.
Mouse, on the last day, remember this.

Lying with you, Né, in the sun, in the (clouds)
half-listening to the Senegalese preacher
two mornings after the riots
when they ran Mame Mbaye down to the gutter
& wishing you would go buy your mutes
& play again, here, in silence, —
for them & for me & yourself & the polis —
Bach’s Suiten für Violoncello No. 1.
To watch in dumb show the formal motions
that reify language & music — the flesh;
your shoulder & forearm & wrist
& lightly-draped fingers one continuous
dependent assemblage flowing south to the river
at Arganzuela & the chuckling magpies.
There is an authority in you, when you play,
that is different from the authority
of the whap | whap of rotor blades overhead;
control that is liberation, a concentration
that is neither at one point nor diffuse,
like the globes of light hovering over the lampposts
in your myopia last night; wandering
across the river, the madrileños
also entonados swaying like palm fronds
in the wind; then the dark, & our one body
with its artifacts of pregnancy & loss.
An authority that is different from the authority
of the Lord in hís dead city, hís kingdom
that has no contiguity with ours, no conformitá,
the streets empty of opposition
& neither wind nor rain; nor thunder, nor tears.
Now a thin sun is dwelling in the wind.
I wd like to reach out to you in its cold light
& pull the shape of your body into mine;
put my tongue against your eyes
so I can taste what it is you see through them;
the restaurant opening, the crisp cloths.
Even the polis with their holsters & war clubs
looking on carefully & asexually
like angels come to lie with the daughters of men.
A kestrel on a lamppost strips the bascinet
from a cricket with slow, considerate
motions: lovely rare flame.
Have they buried Mame Mbaye? They are erasing
a name from the wall & the quarter is pacified.
Clouds rise above Guadarrama,
Somosierra, above the meseta like kites.
The picoletos shift from foot to foot in long
black boots. Bells bleat — lambs;
Alsatians on leashes. The bougainvillea —
glad to bring us at last the first trace
of its colors — flaunts a breathless restraint.

Up on the roof, waiting for the fireworks to begin in warm winter rain, a moment ago I stepped from the elevator into the black air of an almost New Year and need a minute to catch my breath at the spread of city open to my eye. I can't go to the edge; I never could. The old fear of height still troubles me, the sensation that nothing can be under me if I am surrounded by mist and rain and all of the dark night air we breathe. Even a glimpse at the treetops in the park, with its slick crisscrossing roads that plunge into the jumbled panorama of East Side Manhattan, hysterical tonight with its own incandescence, gives me the willies. I feel as if I were standing on the deck of a showboat of a cloud as it drifts down some dark river, waiting for it to bang into some other building's fifteenth floor. How can these old people hunch the railing, hoisting their plastic glasses of champagne from under dripping umbrellas, as if they drank the rain as they laugh their analyses of the weather? Maybe now, like me, they have nothing to lose. I moved in three weeks ago; this is my first trip to the roof. I don't want to die tonight, the first fatality of 1990! There's too much of me I left in pieces last year, oh, the whole last decade: But I'm up here to distract myself, temporarily, from what I don't want or can't have in the way of love. . . . That must be the Triborough Bridge, tied in its strings of blue lights, and I can see in Central Park the skating rink, like a scoured mirror below, where some madman waves a red lantern; he must be drunk. I have only sipped a speck of Drambuie, which I didn't carry in my Coca-Cola glass up to these festivities. This is the first New Year's I've spent alone in twenty, twenty-two years. I never could go to the edge; but I did. Out there in the dark: my marriage, the woman I loved badly, as she did me, or none too well; the places we lived; the apartment I once half-owned; the thousands of books I had to leave behind (though I am to be granted library privileges) and the black and white cat I really miss. My wife's with her friends tonight somewhere in Brooklyn; friends of mine out there, too, though I don't know where. It's just like me to move in the middle of a telephone company strike. Thus, no calls from anyone—and I don't even have a telephone yet, so who could call? Damp but trying to smile, I eye the revelers. Two young men and their enormous girlfriends have joined us, really large women who carry balloons, all ready to froth in merry champagne. We check our watches to the screams from swarms of apartment windows to the west as the sky lights up with the first furious bombardment of colored shells. I can see that red lantern swinging toward the rockets—aha! So it wasn't a drunk, but the fireworks engineer preparing to blow the year's last sky to smithereens for our delight! I like to follow the tiny spurts of flame from the launching pad in their heavenward trajectory as much as I like the rockets' red glare, the bombs bursting in air, which give proof to the night that I am still here, hands jammed in the pockets of my sodden raincoat, face dripping with rain, hat soaked, wondering if the skinny guy in the army jacket behind me (who looks just like I did in the sixties) is mumbling his way into a combat flashback and ready to hurl me over the edge of the roof and into kingdom come. I guess not yet. We've survived the first blasts of spinning green, corkscrews of spangled flame, buds of fireballs spewed in arching gold sprays, the whistling fire-fish that curl and howl as they flare, falling to ash. Screaming its head off, the New York New Year enters. I feel sad that beautiful things must die, even shadows made of smoke and flame, whatever I thought I had made out of my life— music, poems, books, kisses, a little useless fame. The army guy behind me grumbles at the haze of rocket smoke that coils around the trees, then tumbles up into the air toward Harlem. That bump and thud and bump sound everywhere, more clouds smacking each other head-on. The flashes of the explosions are close enough to touch if you wanted to burn your fingers on the sky, and the glare rocks our shadows back against the brick, as if chaos snapped our pictures in the dark. I smile for my portrait, curious at the New Year, smelling the acrid smoke of the one we've just destroyed. Then I squeeze into the tiny elevator car with the others, anonymous, reconciled to be so, back to my little apartment and the waiting glass of amber drink I'll raise, only half in jest, to my new life.

from the elevator into the black air
of an almost New Year
and need a minute to catch my breath
at the spread of city open to my eye.
I can't go to the edge; I never could.
The old fear of height still troubles me,
the sensation that nothing can be under me
if I am surrounded by mist and rain
and all of the dark night air we breathe.
Even a glimpse at the treetops in the park,
with its slick crisscrossing roads that plunge
into the jumbled panorama of East Side Manhattan,
hysterical tonight with its own incandescence,
gives me the willies. I feel as if
I were standing on the deck of a showboat of a cloud
as it drifts down some dark river, waiting for it
to bang into some other building's fifteenth floor.
How can these old people hunch the railing,
hoisting their plastic glasses of champagne
from under dripping umbrellas, as if

Maybe now, like me, they have nothing to lose.
I moved in three weeks ago; this is my first trip
to the roof. I don't want to die tonight,
the first fatality of 1990! There's too much of me
I left in pieces last year, oh, the whole last decade:
But I'm up here to distract myself, temporarily,

which I didn't carry in my Coca-Cola glass
up to these festivities. This is the first New Year's
I've spent alone in twenty, twenty-two years.
I never could go to the edge; but I did.
Out there in the dark: my marriage, the woman
I loved badly, as she did me, or none too well;
the places we lived; the apartment I once half-owned;
the thousands of books I had to leave behind
(though I am to be granted library privileges)
and the black and white cat I really miss.
My wife's with her friends tonight somewhere in Brooklyn;
friends of mine out there, too, though I don't know
where. It's just like me to move in the middle
of a telephone company strike. Thus, no calls
from anyone—and I don't even have
a telephone yet, so who could call? Damp but trying
to smile, I eye the revelers. Two young men
and their enormous girlfriends have joined us,
really large women who carry balloons, all ready
to froth in merry champagne. We check
our watches to the screams from swarms
of apartment windows to the west
as the sky lights up with the first furious
bombardment of colored shells. I can see that
red lantern swinging toward the rockets—aha!
So it wasn't a drunk, but the fireworks engineer
preparing to blow the year's last sky
to smithereens for our delight!
I like to follow the tiny spurts of flame
from the launching pad in their heavenward trajectory
as much as I like the rockets' red glare,
the bombs bursting in air, which give proof
to the night that I am still here, hands
jammed in the pockets of my sodden raincoat,
face dripping with rain, hat soaked, wondering
if the skinny guy in the army jacket behind me
(who looks just like I did in the sixties)
is mumbling his way into a combat flashback
and ready to hurl me over the edge of the roof
and into kingdom come. I guess not yet. We've
survived the first blasts of spinning green,
corkscrews of spangled flame, buds of fireballs
spewed in arching gold sprays, the whistling fire-fish
that curl and howl as they flare, falling to ash.
Screaming its head off, the New York New Year enters.
I feel sad that beautiful things must die,
even shadows made of smoke and flame,
whatever I thought I had made out of my life—
music, poems, books, kisses, a little useless fame.
The army guy behind me grumbles at the haze
of rocket smoke that coils around the trees,
then tumbles up into the air toward Harlem.
That bump and thud and bump sound everywhere,
more clouds smacking each other head-on.
The flashes of the explosions are close enough
to touch if you wanted to burn your fingers
on the sky, and the glare rocks our shadows back
against the brick, as if chaos snapped
our pictures in the dark. I smile for my portrait,
curious at the New Year, smelling the acrid smoke
of the one we've just destroyed. Then I squeeze into
the tiny elevator car with the others, anonymous,
reconciled to be so, back to my little apartment
and the waiting glass of amber drink I'll raise,
only half in jest, to my new life.

One day we’re told to look at the sun

through a hole in a cereal box     All there is to be seen

is the rest of  the world disappearing     This

somehow shadows aliveness but almost

everyone who has ever lived is restlessly sleeping as dead

For who     About what     The end is near over


& over yet we insist on making dates to keep talking

Always about the last eclipse the next blood

flower buck worm strawberry ice wolf event

Then there’s a last constellation we might ever see

until there’s something else to look out for


Gone are the frightening & gorgeous conspirators

that I’m sure I will not see again

Traces of sweat & mystery streaks

some hells     communion & of course

a few awkward goodbyes     The mattress is

gone forever like so many of the bodies I’ve worshipped


Here we are left with impressions

& a recollection of  my side of  the story     I cry

w/ one eye all the time but the right one staid defiant


What would you read to someone you

love if you knew that they were dying


If  it’s over again can we share more than black sites &

drownings     skin turned confetti     blue turned coal

& innards swept down sewers w/ brooms

We give way beyond what we know     So the gun

in my mouth made me a monster for a while

Coming back shoeless calloused me

everywhere but the bottoms of feet     Someone


dressed like a traitor convinced me

there are loyalties that deserve to be broken     Someone

w/ death to the klan on the door

let me know I already broke free


Hear them both     They’re dead & it’s tricky

since the decomposed & me are close but here

I am w/ you     The friend who is you

Impossible almost lover you     The us

we chose as family you & others in the fullness of  time


None of us breed but someone will give

birth behind bulletproof glass where life &

the divide begin     This is a fabled event

packaged as betterment     It will spawn someone

who pays to spray us


like invasive bugs in the street     Cops

were children so we can look forward to

good regime/bad regime during future

questioning     Thanks for the theater

but we’ve seen the play     Civil discourse is broken

down in the destruction manual     They can have all

the orchestras     Classical music will never drown out the sins


What would you write to someone you

love if   you thought you might be dying


Maybe once I was someone who I’d love to see

punched in the face     But I am here & not yet dead so

a constellation of the imaginary is no imaginary

constellation     There is no sky w/o a dream of sky     You

who are family   fuck a grid & thanks to you I see

brightness independent of state-­sponsored power


We talk about who threw that brick through

the window     & how it’s now part of a path in a garden

Broken glass is as old as glass     but the sound is

more than fresh wounds     There are fresh worlds still to be heard


Oh  & you my friend   I will fight anyone who says

you’re not pretty     That is just ridiculous talk     Distant

impractical you     I believed we could be possible w/ translation

software & hearts-for-eyes emojis     No dice

but not before I entertained

dressing in a tux as your husband     Look


I never thought when you said no more haircuts

until wars were over that you’d never have

short hair again     My beautiful barber

brushes my face     I feel funny I

moan a weird prayer for peace     I guess it could happen

lol     after all we deserve a new start     Soon we’ll be dead & brag

about riches     We were here & looked right into the sun

What can I tell you?

My only love sprung  from my only hate!
— Romeo and Juliet, Act I, Scene v


At forty, I studied the mirror. I poked my mouth to free a trapped grain of hamburger, and a tooth broke off  between my fingers. I felt nothing. The dentist said: The tooth is dead.

I learned to swallow blood and words. For years, I would mimic their rooster strut, the sneering lip stuck out, the bellowing battle cry of ba fangool. I rooted against Rocky in all the Rocky movies, cheering his choreographed pratfalls to the canvas. When they rushed out the door of the pizza joint to gawk at the booming car wreck on the corner, leaving my eggplant parm sub to burn black in the oven, I called them goombahs and swore never to return. I am sixty.

Her mother’s name is Giovio, Calabrese from New Jersey, her grandfather a stonemason before the beam rammed his head and the stroke crippled his right hand, her great-grandmother a girl sewing buttons onto blouses who escaped the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire, as others leapt, hand in hand, eyes shut, from the ninth floor. I can no longer remember the curses in the poetry of Shakespeare and Donald DeBlasio. She takes my hand, and leads me across the bridge to the ruins of the castle on the other side of the river, through the labyrinth of stone, up to the jagged battlements, where we listen to the silence of the builders, and the birds, and the silence again.
My only love sprung  from my only hate!

At forty, I studied the mirror. I poked my mouth to free a trapped grain of hamburger, and a tooth broke off  between my fingers. I felt nothing. The dentist said: The tooth is dead.

a thousand times before.

not give it away — then it is yours to give away — the spirit
riddled like this — if in her arms I read a story — if out of her
arms I had the choice to write one but I chose not — chose not
because I did not know where I was going — because my path
broke down & I had this choice — stay or split — if I knew that
were I to split one part of me would become a ghost — if I did
not know yet which part — if the voice calling me out asked me
to describe the splitting & I did — if I said it was like smoke
spiraling outwards — it was like smoke lifting off me taking on
form & leaving me — if  it was like a delicate girl I never met
but dreamed of — if it was like the flags of my youth fluttering,
far out at sea — like breathing out a breath you will never take
back in — but you know you can never take any breath back in —
if I saw her outside of myself & mourned her like I have mourned
no other loss — if I knew it was both a miracle & the most terrible
tragedy — to open up — release a flame — watch the flame go —
have you seen it? A flame that can ride water — she was my
daughter & if I could I would send her to you, if I sent her to you
would you take her? Listen, I ran this out of me because I knew
it would burn me down — my trainers press the ground & lift up
again — I saw myself on my back in high grass in high summer
with everything coming to me — how this ghost left me & printed
a new person all over me — I could peel her off or live like this —
I cried — one or both will destroy me! — the spirit called it fate but
I knew it was just drama — I will never know why a good person must die —
fate does not exist I said, but every door I opened showed yes
yes yes — I shut each one & locked it — checked the locks
three times — went back & checked them again — shook them to be
sure — drew hearts round the keyholes so the spirit would know
I loved her — it wasn’t — it was never — that I didn’t love her —

By Bill Zavatsky
By Bill Zavatsky
Not long after you had told me, gently, that you still grieved for your last love, though that had ended almost a year before, and that you could have no intimate relationship with me, maybe not with anyone for a time, I stopped my fork in the air with whatever hung on the end of it that I was eating. My throat wouldn't swallow. I felt weak and sick, as if it were myself that I devoured, piece by piece, as you talked away the hopes that I had put in your lovely face. It was the old story coming true for me once more, though you were hardly mine. . . . When we finished I walked you back to your car; I don't remember having much to say. Why would I? Buildings drifted by, and cars, and faces. Then we arrived at the place where, afterwards, I would never see you again, at a parking lot near Times Square. There I marked the sidewalk with X's visible only to me: ""At this place I was lost again,"" they'd say to me when I walked there in the future. ""Dig here and find what's left of me, or what I left behind, where X marks the spot."" I felt like the death's-head and crossed bones that surmount the treasure chest. I only felt a little like gold coins and jewels. I have signed the City with these sphinxes —in parks, in streets, in bedrooms, in my own apartments. And there we stood, you and I, hemmed in by the stitches of X's that could not hold you to me. But X's mean kisses, I realized, as well as what is lost: all the kisses I couldn't give you chalked like symbols on the sidewalk. After all, you yourself had been marked by loss, even in your laughter that afternoon at the show I had taken you to. Bright-eyed and smiling in the seat beside me, you stole my glances with your dark, dark eyes and your long hair. I thought that I had not been this happy in a long time with a woman and was ready to become even more happy, ready to do anything that you wanted in order to please you, to see that smile come up, not knowing what you were soon to say to me as we dined. And when you spoke, I felt life fall away from me. Again I felt that I would never be happy. I felt the words that I had wanted to say to you leaving me, rushing out of my chest like dead air, until I had no more words to say. I seemed to cut and swallow my food as if it were me myself that stuck in pieces on the end of the fork I had raised to my mouth. Had I been chewing on my own flesh? Self-Pity the Devourer took me by the hand that held the fork, and once again I feasted on all that was dark and hopeless in myself, in lieu of all that was beautiful, desirable, and unattainable in you. And then I stood beside you in the lot where you had parked your car, with the X's buzzing in the air, sticking themselves to you and me and the blacktop and the cars. When you reached out to embrace me, I moved to embrace you in return—and then came the part that I don't want to remember, the part I hate: I caught a glimpse of your face as we put our arms around each other, and your face said everything to me about how you had wasted the afternoon, how eager you were to speed away in your car, a mixture of disgust and relief that the thing would soon be over, that I would be crossed out forever from your life—and everything that I hated about myself, my stupid chin, my ugly nose, my hopeless balded head, my stuck-out ears, my wreck of a heart, crashed over me, spinning me into the vortex of a palpable self-hate that I have only ever let myself feel a little bit at a time, though it is always there

That's what the first line says of the song I've been playing all summer at the keyboard—trying to get my hands around its dark, melancholy chords, its story line of a melody that twists up like snakes from melodic minor scales that I've also been trying to learn, though I'm no great shakes as a practicer of scales. Come to think of it, neither am I much when it comes to love—no great shakes, I mean. Not that I haven't had my chances. Twenty years married, I made a lousy husband, half asleep, selfish, more like a big baby than a grown man, the poet laureate of the self-induced coma when it came to doing anything for anybody but me. ""Now and then he took his thumb out of his mouth to write an ode to or a haiku about the thumb he sucked all day."" That's what I imagined my ex-wife said to our therapist near the end. She did say: ""It's all about Bill."" She was right. And suddenly it frightens me, remembering how, at our wedding, our poet friends read poems of (mostly) utter depression to salute us. I wondered if their griefs in love had double-crossed our union, if strange snakes in the grass of our blissful Eden had hissed at us, and now I worry, on your wedding day, if I'm not doing the same damned thing . . . . I haven't come to spring up and put my curse on your bliss. Here's what I want to say: You're young. You don’t know what love is. And as the next line of the song goes, you won't —""Until you know the meaning of the blues."" Darlings, the blues will come (though not often, I hope) to raise their fiery swords against your paradise. A little of that you unwittingly got today, when it rained and you couldn't be married outside under the beautiful tree in Nan and Alan's yard. But paradise doesn't have to be structured so that we can never reenter it. After you've kicked each other out of it once or twice (I'm speaking metaphorically, of course), teach yourself how to say a few kind words to each other. Don't stand there angry, stony. Each of you let the other know what you are feeling and thinking and then it may be possible to return to each other smiling, hand in hand. For arm in arm, you are your best Eden. Remember the advice the old poet sang to you on the afternoon of August 4, 2001, the day you got married. May you enjoy a good laugh thinking of him and his silver thumb now that you've turned the key into your new life in the beautiful Massachusetts rain and—hey, now—sun!

It will be windy for a while until it isn’t. The waves will shoal. A red-legged cormorant will trace her double along glassy water, forgetting they are hungry. The sea will play this motif over and over, but there will be no preparing for it otherwise. Water will quiver in driftwood. Sound preceding absence, a white dog trailing a smaller one: ghost and noon shadow, two motes disappearing into surf. And when the low tide comes lapping and clear, the curled fronds of seaweed will furl and splay, their algal sisters brushing strands against sands where littleneck clams feed underwater. Light rain will fall and one cannot help but lean into the uncertainty of the sea. Bow: a knot of two loops, two loose ends, our bodies on either side of this shore where we will dip our hands to feel what can’t be seen. Horseshoe crabs whose blue blood rich in copper will reach for cover, hinged between clouds and sea. It will never be enough, the bull kelp like a whip coiling in tender hands, hands who know to take or be taken, but take nothing with them: I will marry you. I will marry you. So we can owe what we own to every beautiful thing.

By Ari Banias
You recount the history of the French garden. From above, I see tight rows of trees beside threadbare grass. When the language teacher talks about le capitalisme: the gesture of three fingers rubbing imaginary fabric. I’m a tourist, vulnerable and stupid, my legs showing, shoes practical, face red. Together, we try to reconstruct an anecdote whose contents have scattered. A motorcycle passes, a French police siren you say sounds innocuous then we both laugh sourly. I hadn’t seen a woman slap a child in some time. A truck reversing, and the alarm that continues for hours one morning. Porn on a handheld device, its tinny echo in a room with bare floors and very little furniture. Across the courtyard, this T-shirt on a hanger out the window turns in the light breeze as if trying to look behind itself. I’m consumed with not knowing where to buy paper, safety pins, stamps. The window frames of that building are red, emerging from gray gables. Enormous bumblebee at the threshold investigates the doorway, doesn’t enter. The flies do; they’re promiscuous; they leave. I don’t know the word for because. So each act is disconnected from another. I can almost imagine there are no consequences, the days just pass, one sunny, one cloudy, someone unseen shouts, sirens every few hours, clouds move in a solemn procession across a wide sky staggered with chimneys, people wait to cross the street, a large tree tosses its wig a little. Other small trees in the courtyard flicker. They are responsive. The sun heats the pavement; le pavé répond. You send me a short erotic video, you’re naked, propositioning me. Do you act more like the coin or the water? Across the narrow street this bird sipping from roof puddles seems more dove than pigeon. Pacing, grandmotherly, she stops to look at me. Do you just know how to love another person like someone knew to paint those window frames red? Most of the architecture looks floral, like a boring math problem. The crosses that reach and reach. Why does the scrape of the furniture when I rearrange it sound like crass American English to me? I slept late, now I’m watching the clouds, like clouds in an eighteenth-century painting. Overly articulate. Except these clouds are not trying to symbolize anything. Where’s my dove. I always want to go look at people. A booth selling copies of copies of Louis Vuitton. The small shadow the roof makes on another roof right next to it. When my friend came to Paris she wanted to break everything. Impeccable shoes on the impeccable feet. Clothes so new they’re creamy, and to seem to never have to  compromise. I feel tattered when I’m actually not. I’m an American, I eat. A huge decorative basket of citrus snugged beside me in the upscale bistro. The woman from a building opposite comes down, indignant: Who threw a pomelo into my window? You read to me about the history of the barricade. I picture the drab suburbs. The shoulders and elbows of people in the museum evoke more reaction in me than most of the paintings. A young lithe person with live eyes tends bar, gender trouble tattooed up their arm. I count twenty-nine sleeping bags lined up beneath the overhang and each one inhabited. I read to you about the history of enclosure. Two people talking on a balcony, their black hair blowing. One leaning over into the courtyard. Behind the cathedral, vulgar black felt stapled in the raised flowerbeds to mask their frames. The river stinks, allures, as a specific person can. A repository, a consequence, a long sentence, an ongoing story. The generous current cut through by a party boat shouting wooo! wooo! wooooooo! wooo! emitting an obscene light waving at whatever will wave back.

You recount the history of the French garden.

From above, I see tight rows of trees beside threadbare grass.

When the language teacher talks about le capitalisme:

the gesture of three fingers rubbing imaginary fabric.

I’m a tourist, vulnerable and stupid,

my legs showing, shoes practical, face red.

Together, we try to reconstruct an anecdote

whose contents have scattered. A motorcycle passes, a French police siren

you say sounds innocuous then we both laugh sourly.

I hadn’t seen a woman slap a child in some time.

A truck reversing, and the alarm that continues for hours one morning.

Porn on a handheld device, its tinny echo in a room

with bare floors and very little furniture.

Across the courtyard, this T-shirt on a hanger out the window

turns in the light breeze as if trying to look behind itself.

I’m consumed with not knowing where to buy paper, safety pins, stamps.

The window frames of that building are red, emerging from gray gables.

Enormous bumblebee at the threshold investigates the doorway, doesn’t enter.

The flies do; they’re promiscuous; they leave.

I don’t know the word for because.

So each act is disconnected from another.

I can almost imagine there are no consequences,

the days just pass, one sunny, one cloudy, someone unseen shouts, sirens

every few hours, clouds move in a solemn procession across

a wide sky staggered with chimneys,

people wait to cross the street, a large tree tosses its wig a little.

Other small trees in the courtyard flicker.

They are responsive.

The sun heats the pavement; le pavé répond.

You send me a short erotic video, you’re naked, propositioning me.

Do you act more like the coin or the water?

Across the narrow street this bird

sipping from roof puddles

seems more dove than pigeon.

Pacing, grandmotherly, she stops to look at me.

Do you just know how to love another person

like someone knew to paint those window frames red?

Most of the architecture looks floral, like a boring math problem.

The crosses that reach and reach.

Why does the scrape of the furniture when I rearrange it

sound like crass American English to me?

I slept late, now I’m watching the clouds, like clouds

in an eighteenth-century painting. Overly articulate.

Except these clouds are not trying to symbolize anything.

Where’s my dove.

I always want to go look at people.

A booth selling copies of copies of Louis Vuitton.

The small shadow the roof makes on another roof right next to it.

When my friend came to Paris she wanted to break everything.

Impeccable shoes on the impeccable feet.

Clothes so new they’re creamy, and to seem to never have to  compromise.

I feel tattered when I’m actually not.

I’m an American, I eat.

A huge decorative basket of citrus snugged beside me in the upscale bistro.

The woman from a building opposite comes down, indignant:

Who threw a pomelo into my window?

You read to me about the history of the barricade.

I picture the drab suburbs.

The shoulders and elbows of people in the museum evoke more reaction

in me than most of the paintings.

A young lithe person with live eyes tends bar, gender trouble tattooed up their arm.

I count twenty-nine sleeping bags lined up beneath the overhang

and each one inhabited.

I read to you about the history of enclosure.

Two people talking on a balcony, their black hair blowing.

One leaning over into the courtyard.

Behind the cathedral, vulgar black felt stapled in the raised flowerbeds

to mask their frames.

The river stinks, allures, as a specific person can.

A repository, a consequence, a long sentence, an ongoing story.

The generous current cut through by a party boat shouting

wooo! wooo! wooooooo! wooo!

emitting an obscene light

waving at whatever will wave back.

there’s nothing in my face. There is nothing in yours. What we have are called heads. They are nothing unless we kiss. Lips are wonderful. They are full of mechanoreceptors. In the Old World we all used to kiss and kiss. It was then that we did have faces. We had noses and cheeks and foreheads and soft, downy hair. In the New World we stopped kissing. Those who were already here stopped. Those who came stopped. Now there are only four people who have heads that are also faces. They are an artist and three children for whom I have a face other than my hands.

The eyes
open to the cries
of police.

Skirting sleep,
the soul
industrial

as laundry—
realities
like bad checks,

burning
like new sex.
Dinner

is the better half
of someone’s
lunch. Someone’s

playing
a guessing
game:

Psychosis
or Handsfree.
Local fame.

Praying
to a calf,
or debt ceiling,

keeps
us grounded.
You can take

the kid
out the food court,
but child support

won’t upgrade
from buy
to buy—

outbid,
I am my
financial aide.

Astounded,
we wake
and take.

Let every boy
Tolstoy
with disease

have a chance.
Liabilities,
let’s dance.

We’re clean—
or rather, not
unclean—

doxycycline
our balance
sheet.

Our spirits, neat.

It is eighty degrees in December.
It is he, on one of his furloughs,
bringing himself — and hell — up to date.
My Don Juan, the better climber
(as the mercury yo-yos),
is in a newly roused state,
the world circumcised away
from an out-of-season bud
leaving at the scrupulous rim,
as it unfurls, a darker appliqué,
like O-positive frozen solid
at the sight of one’s resuscitated victim.

This rosebush assiduously forks over
its works where most grandifloras falter,
thriving as far into the year as Capricorn.
While named after a lover,
it decorates its own altar
and wields an extraordinary thorn:
once I saw it catch a football
in those semiquaver quasi-teeth;
it is three-headed, like Cerberus,
a hybrid drawing bloodlines from a root-ball
on hands all that’s impure lies beneath.
Hands can train it, barbarous

as it is, on an arbor, and I might like
to take its thick canes in harness,
first pouring cement as a base
(so it would know I meant business).
Always poised to strike,
they eventually undo their stays,
baying out like a window
of garnet, as at Chartres
(torture chamber in its basement,
or so I hear). I wonder how
such a daemon rose got its start,
what fairy tale explains its scent    ...

It is almost Christmas. Stacks

A wire basket of freckled pears

If I beg and pray you to set me free, then bind me more tightly still.
— Homer


I’m striving to be a better astronaut, but consider where I’m coming from, the exosphere, a desk where the bluest air thins to a lip. Impossible to know the difference from where I sit and space. I promise I still dream of coming back to you, settling on your yellow for the kitchen. We won’t fight. Let it not manifest. Not over the crumpled bodies of laundry. Let us not row over the nail polish, its color, the spilled sun. Inspiration is the deadliest radiation. It never completely leaves the bones. You know.From here, there are no obstructions but the radiant nothingness. An aurora borealis opens like a fish. This. To the pyramids, yes, to a great wall. And there you are, moving from curtain to curtain. O, to fantasize of having chosen some design with you. But the moons over Jupiter. But asteroids like gods deadened by the weight of waiting. I remember you said pastel for the cabinet where the spice rack lives. That I ought’ve picked you up flowers when I had a chance. Daisy, iris, sun. Red roses. Ultraviolet, the color of love (what else but this startles the air open like an egg?). I’m really trying to be better, to commit to memory the old songs about the ground, to better sense your latitudes, see the corona of your face. Take your light as it arrives. Earth is heavenly too. But know that time is precious here. How wine waits years and years to peak. What is there to do: I’ve made love to satellites in your name. I’m saying I can’t say when I’ll return. Remember me, for here are dragons and the noble songs of sirens. Stars that sway elysian. Ships that will not moor, lovers who are filled with blood and nothing more. Who could love you like this? Who else will sew you in the stars? Who better knows your gravity and goes otherwise, to catastrophe? I’ve schemed and promised to bring you back a ring from Saturn. But a week passes, or doesn’t manage. Everything steers impossible against the boundless curb of light. Believe I tried for you. Against space. Time takes almost everything away. To you. For you. A toast to the incredible. I almost wish I’d never seen the sky when always there was you. Sincerely,
If I beg and pray you to set me free, then bind me more tightly still.

Impossible to know the difference from where I sit and space. I promise I still dream of coming back to you, settling on your yellow for the kitchen. We won’t fight. Let it not manifest. Not over the crumpled bodies of laundry. Let us not row over the nail polish, its color, the spilled sun. Inspiration is the deadliest radiation. It never completely leaves the bones. You know.From here, there are no obstructions but the radiant nothingness. An aurora borealis opens like a fish. This. To the pyramids, yes, to a great wall. And there you are, moving from curtain to curtain. O, to fantasize of having chosen some design with you. But the moons over Jupiter. But asteroids like gods deadened by the weight of waiting. I remember you said pastel for the cabinet where the spice rack lives. That I ought’ve picked you up flowers when I had a chance. Daisy, iris, sun. Red roses. Ultraviolet, the color of love (what else but this startles the air open like an egg?). I’m really trying to be better, to commit to memory the old songs about the ground, to better sense your latitudes, see the corona of your face. Take your light as it arrives. Earth is heavenly too. But know that time is precious here. How wine waits years and years to peak. What is there to do: I’ve made love to satellites in your name. I’m saying I can’t say when I’ll return. Remember me, for here are dragons and the noble songs of sirens. Stars that sway elysian. Ships that will not moor, lovers who are filled with blood and nothing more. Who could love you like this? Who else will sew you in the stars? Who better knows your gravity and goes otherwise, to catastrophe? I’ve schemed and promised to bring you back a ring from Saturn. But a week passes, or doesn’t manage. Everything steers impossible against the boundless curb of light. Believe I tried for you. Against space. Time takes almost everything away. To you. For you. A toast to the incredible. I almost wish I’d never seen the sky when always there was you. Sincerely,
If I beg and pray you to set me free, then bind me more tightly still.

A collective family myth
passed down across generations
takes on the polished gleam of truth,
and memories become legend.

The legend of black sod-busters
on a piece of red soil they own
in a township of black ranchers.
Their legendary rodeo.

grand entry

Two Stars and Stripes flutter into
the arena, carried by two
men in jeans, red shirts, white Stetsons.
Guiding their horses with left hands,
holding the flagstaffs in their rights,
their backs straight and tall, their faces,
their chestnut faces, beautiful
in the light of the setting sun.

After them, two by two,
banners waving, hooves raising dust,
ride the Horse People of Boley,
a varicolored promenade.
They canter once around the ring,
then they circle into the sky.

mutton busting

In the cluster of five-year-old
contenders wearing life jackets
and bicycle helmets, paper
numbers safety-pinned to their backs,
you line up one by one for a turn
to hang on tight with your legs squeezed
at the sheep’s broad middle, fingers
holding handfuls of deep, warm wool
as the sheep destiny presents
runs you out to cheering applause.
Whether you’ll fall on top of it,
or it on you, you won’t fall far.
You have no front teeth anyway,
and a brown clown gone pick you up.

bareback riding

This horse was bred and born to buck.
He’s a good horse, he’ll give you points.
Gloved hand in the rigging’s handle,
bare brown hand waving in the air,
you whir your spurs at his shoulders
as he leaps, twists, and jolts your bones.
Four seconds or four hundred years.
But if you can get up and slap
the dust off your jeans with your hat,
the future’s eyes, looking at you,
will fill with forevering light:
light that will make generations
of proud brown people remember
the Black Horse People of Boley.

bulldogging

In truth there’s seldom a reason
for a man to wrestle a steer,
unless he’s a real ranch cowboy
dealing with ornery power.
Maybe, while rounding up the herd,
he bumps heads with testosterone,
and it’s testosterone-vs.-
testosterone. Bill Pickett learned,
watching dogs on a Boley ranch,
that sometimes you’ve got to bulldog
a hardhead with a kiss of pain.
Today, you slide from horse onto
the fleeing steer, grab his horns, pull
five hundred pounds of muscle down.

team roping, calf roping, steer roping

Roping always involves a team,
whether it’s two men or women
or one human and one smart horse.
The aim: to bring down and hog-tie
a big scared baby of a calf
or a full-grown and pissed-off steer.
You gallop out swinging your loop
with one hand, the other holding
the slack and the unneeded reins.
You down him with a careful toss,
tie three of his hooves together,
step back with wide arms and a grin.
A rope isn’t always a noose:
ropes in brown hands can be lassos.

saddle bronc riding

It’s not the leather riding gloves
and it’s not the fringed buckskin chaps,
not the worn-in and dusty boots,
not the spurs’ blunted silver stars,
not the 10x wide-brimmed straw hat
(both winged helmet and regal crown):
it’s not clothes that make the cowboy.
It’s something behind a bronzed face,
in the level gaze from dark eyes,
and, of course, it’s heart that puts you,
the reins in one hand, one hand free,
waving with the horse’s rhythm,
your heels spurring from neck to flank,
on this bronc called America.

barrel racing

Thunder explodes out of the chute.
Mane and tail whip in the speed wind,
agile hooves pound a swift tempo
circling around the first barrel.
One hand grips the horn, the other
communicates with the taut reins,
though your thighs give the best guidance,
telling your horse to maneuver
in circles that hug the barrels.
Three barrels, a tight cloverleaf
you gallop through with one joined will.
This contest pits you and your horse
against the clock and your best time.
Sister, your dreadlocks are flying!

pony express

Before telegraph, news traveled
from mouth to ear, from hand to hand.
News arrived old. From sea to sea
took weeks, unless carried by boys
stationed along the stagecoach route
to race a cross-country relay.
Your pulse gallops toward the handoff,
when your teammate takes the baton
and the noise and flurry go on
without you. Your leg run, you and
your horse (your partner, your friend) stand
encompassed in adrenalin,
watching, as the Ancestors must,
unable to help, but cheering.

tennessee walker

Let’s hear it for the barrel men,
for the bullfighters, for the clowns,
for the men on the side ready
to run toward trouble. Give it up
for the musical director
(thanks for the hip-hop, bro!). And for
the announcer and all the folks
cheering in the stands. That baby
wearing a tiny cowboy hat.
That man the same black as his horse,
in that white suit and fedora.
His Tennessee Walker’s proud gait
as he nods to his own rhythm,
tail an ebony waterfall.

bull riding

Boley bulls are bred for bucking,
bred to be mean, to be “Bad Boys.”
They teach you to sit strong, hold on,
and with one hand reach for the sky.
After riding a Boley bull
a cowboy thinks, Hell, I’ve been there.
I’ve held the bull-rope, raked my spurs,
while that bad boy tried to kill me.
A ton of Brahma seeing red
gives you a whole new perspective,
a who-you-think-you-talking-to
fearlessness. You’ve seen the bull’s eye:
you know you can’t die more than once.
You’ve lived through eight Mississippis.

Aztec girl twisting her hair into a braid
when the army arrives.
She sees them in her citadel,

her nickname for the city
forgotten by her mouth’s mind.

The Spanish writer who keeps the oldest codex saw grief

when the papers of the people’s prayers were burned by the soldiers.

Havoc, my freedom, without a history I invent my own.

Say I am of many faces,
neither white nor brown,
say violet,

the color that speaks like violence.

Legacy sounds like lost at sea.

Say it wasn’t precious to me, identity.
Strange, dangerous innocence.
The earth is an onion strung with lights, my eyes sting
from the blaze.
A gold hawk joins

the ring of fox in heavy dew around me early and I
am part of their wet ritual in my wish

to turn from what is human, even

knowing it was hawk who stole the woodpecker’s redheaded flight.

It was like climbing a mountain to those of us who’d climbed one. To the others, it was like, I suppose, something else. In other words, we let  everybody find her own figure of speech. Not that it—speech—lay thick on the ground, or mountain; it presented itself one word at a time, far between. A body had to keep an eye out, like for firewood at dusk, or else miss her chance. Nobody else, let’s face it, cared about metaphor, or even simile, the like-it-or-not-ness of the mountain pretty much getting  between a body and her musing, in its going. One step at a time, anyone could lose herself or someone else just staring at her feet. And if a body meet a body is not mere speech but something that could happen, like hopping a bus—though on the mountain you’ll catch no rides, worse luck, the mountain requires to be climbed on foot, one after the other, nothing else will get you up it. There’s nothing like such obduracy but in the wild, nobody can tell you otherwise. No simple figure, this struggle: just a crag, your burden, and your own two feet. Say  otherwise, talk through your hat, which I don’t care for.

The diners are stuffed and back for more. Each terrible thing I said to the child will get repeated hopefully as a joke. And like language, these gestures, or a certain way of nodding one’s head, it all eases in with less than a breath. Forget the song’s words, the order of the band’s set tonight. The black moon’s heart’s got that sinister bent and I want to get touched at by the snakes. One of the students in my class used to go bear hunting with his two uncles. They played recordings of distressed animals to lure in tentative animals to kill. This practice is illegal in many places. Because it’s so very effective. I split open the apple and hand the good half to a child on the bus nestled in under the arm of her sleeping mother. Love from here is a long way to go. Get on your bike and ride through the lights.

Where are you?

got that sinister bent
and I want to get
touched at by the snakes.

One of the students in my class
used to go bear hunting with his two uncles.

They played recordings of distressed animals
to lure in tentative animals to kill.

This practice is illegal in many places.
Because it’s so very effective.

I split open the apple

nestled in under the arm of her sleeping mother.

Love from here is a long way to go.

A crow perches inside me. Actually, it is a whale. It is hard to tell by touch alone. Nothing I own ever looks me properly in the eye.

Inside of me the large creatures change their shapes to fit. A blackbird. An organ. Animals with no names. I send them off into the world daily. Little sadness takes flight. Love is a brave child. These things take the shape of their containers. I don’t have to do anythingto hold them.
A crow perches inside me.

Actually, it is a whale. It is hard to tell
by touch alone. Nothing I own ever looks
me properly in the eye. Sometimes

a loud caw at dusk feels
like the largest mammal on Earth.

A deep breath out the blowhole

into my stomach. One second it swims
and the next it is a small extension
of a tree. This is a kind of beginning—

a finger puppet show. The light
dancing around my hands.

Me dancing alone on a stem.

A persimmon blooms.
A boy learns a song and plants it
in an orchard. Inside of me

the large creatures change their shapes
to fit. A blackbird. An organ.

Animals with no names. I send them off
into the world daily. Little sadness
takes flight. Love is a brave child.

These things take the shape

a song their fathers grew

where handmade clouds sound
free from ligament

I am a human fly
wings slick with telepathic goo
an archive of earth piled on my back

This is theater ...
so please assume the role of curtain
I am the director of this fuzz
a tardy imago: the result of clandestine flare
When we returned to your house
we noticed that it wasn’t there
so we built a human pyramid
without flesh
without internal radar or private song
a formation known to drain the color of black suns
and toward this stone we lean
where birds are higher

A snake came to my water-trough
On a hot, hot day, and I in pyjamas for the heat,
To drink there.

In the deep, strange-scented shade of the great dark carob tree
I came down the steps with my pitcher
And must wait, must stand and wait, for there he was at the trough
before me.

He reached down from a fissure in the earth-wall in the gloom
And trailed his yellow-brown slackness soft-bellied down, over
the edge of the stone trough
And rested his throat upon the stone bottom,
And where the water had dripped from the tap, in a small clearness,
He sipped with his straight mouth,
Softly drank through his straight gums, into his slack long body,
Silently.

Someone was before me at my water-trough,
And I, like a second-comer, waiting.

He lifted his head from his drinking, as cattle do,
And looked at me vaguely, as drinking cattle do,
And flickered his two-forked tongue from his lips, and mused
a moment,
And stooped and drank a little more,
Being earth-brown, earth-golden from the burning bowels
of the earth
On the day of Sicilian July, with Etna smoking.

The voice of my education said to me
He must be killed,
For in Sicily the black, black snakes are innocent, the gold
are venomous.

And voices in me said, If you were a man
You would take a stick and break him now, and finish him off.

But must I confess how I liked him,
How glad I was he had come like a guest in quiet, to drink
at my water-trough
And depart peaceful, pacified, and thankless,
Into the burning bowels of this earth?

Was it cowardice, that I dared not kill him?
Was it perversity, that I longed to talk to him?
Was it humility, to feel so honoured?
I felt so honoured.

And yet those voices:
If you were not afraid, you would kill him!

And truly I was afraid, I was most afraid,
But even so, honoured still more
That he should seek my hospitality
From out the dark door of the secret earth.

He drank enough
And lifted his head, dreamily, as one who has drunken,
And flickered his tongue like a forked night on the air, so black,
Seeming to lick his lips,
And looked around like a god, unseeing, into the air,
And slowly turned his head,
And slowly, very slowly, as if thrice adream,
Proceeded to draw his slow length curving round
And climb again the broken bank of my wall-face.

And as he put his head into that dreadful hole,
And as he slowly drew up, snake-easing his shoulders,
and entered farther,
A sort of horror, a sort of protest against his withdrawing into
that horrid black hole,
Deliberately going into the blackness, and slowly drawing
himself after,
Overcame me now his back was turned.

I looked round, I put down my pitcher,
I picked up a clumsy log
And threw it at the water-trough with a clatter.

I think it did not hit him,
But suddenly that part of him that was left behind convulsed
in an undignified haste,
Writhed like lightning, and was gone
Into the black hole, the earth-lipped fissure in the wall-front,
At which, in the intense still noon, I stared with fascination.

And immediately I regretted it.
I thought how paltry, how vulgar, what a mean act!
I despised myself and the voices of my accursed human education.

And I thought of the albatross,
And I wished he would come back, my snake.

For he seemed to me again like a king,
Like a king in exile, uncrowned in the underworld,
Now due to be crowned again.

And so, I missed my chance with one of the lords
Of life.
And I have something to expiate:
A pettiness.

Too busy peddling my fire and trying to keep the mouths fed and packing up belongings of the recent dead right now to access your luxurious philosophy, though one looks forward to a time when the universe permits, I said to my electric correspondent who came at me puffed pink in thoughtfulness when what I needed then as now was a quiet high enough to envision a half-gallon brick of all-natural vanilla ice cream softening on the hot hood of an idling cop car: the earliest rivulets, a slow loss of strict rectangularity, then the wild gliding around on the beautiful bleak enamel paint job as its sweet fragrance fills the air like a gift from Madagascar I can breathe. Rapt Cortés transported cuttings of vanilla across the Atlantic during his plunder of the Aztecs; the Aztecs themselves fell captive to its magic after vanquishing its first cultivators the Totonacs, who paid their conquerors tributes of baskets stacked to heaven with cured vanilla pods like long sentences of salutiferous essence. This is one of those instances history likes to push your face into to try to stir your appetite for cruelty a little, or at least make you covet the perks of it: I too want vanilla in quantity. I want it all around me, like a fortress of mellow dangles. It will move with me as I move and it will ward hateful people off. For centuries Europeans tried to cultivate it outside its native Mexico and failed. They could get the vine to flower, but in the absence of ancestral pollinators, specifically hummingbirds and a stingless bee, the flowers dropped off podless. Meanwhile, Edmond Albius—born into slavery on an island east of Madagascar known then as Bourbon, lush French colony and home to roses, one active volcano, one dormant, and one arena-like caldera that holds the record for most rainfall shed in one location by a single tropical cyclone ever, namely Hyacinthe— knew enough from orchids at age twelve in 1841 to think to lift with a bamboo splint the flap of the rostellum dividing the pollen- heavy male anther from the female stigma in order to rub the pollen on the stigma’s eager wand. Within weeks the pods had begun to form and lengthen into joyous beanlike squiggles laden with tiny seeds like secrets of the universe as Albius at the shore and under bright southern stars breathed out I hope in a kind of enlargement akin to liberty from time, so that on that occasion he might feel briefly as if his own, even as his method of vanilla pollination belonged first to his master, then Madagascar, and then the world, with nearly all vanilla produced today as Albius taught us, including the kind in Breyers since 1866, fourteen years before Albius died unrecognized, in poverty, in misery to be exact, while everyone white around him grew rich with vanilla, adding it to candy, Coca-Cola, Chanel No. 5, and even in effigy to the air freshener dangling down in my Uber, its waves whispering Albius, Albius, but inaudibly.

A scherzo of thumbnail butterflies, white ones, Covers the hillside. God is more Adorable than music. Nevertheless, On a given morning, as the wind drops, Music pries Heaven apart from itself, Like flowers beneath the wings unfolded on them. Every breeze is self-registering. This morning, I walked deeper into the hill, Free of the sun. Midway up the tallest trees, One leaf alone would stir while all the leaves On the very same branch remained stock-still. Apart from itself, Heaven signaled to me. William Blake was no romantic. He was, Beyond the arsons of levity and his toe, The final bulwark of the baroque. He was the last to oppose, “almost Successfully,” rebirth on all the wrong terms. He saw the leaf alone where no light was. Infinite variation plays against A steadfast variety. The butterfly Knows the difference in its wings, even As the flower she alights upon darkens Beneath her weight. The sun goes deeper Into the hill. Root systems and riot shine. Did you think for a moment Earth Was aware of itself? Never. Its adoration Persists altogether elsewhere from The very beginning, beginning again Just at that moment one leaf all alone Spins into the baroque, a scherzo of one note. The hillside is covered with little doors, And the wind rises out of them, returning, When the music is spent, with all the news Of the unaware, unreflecting, nearly perfect Hours blindly about the business of perfection. Hence the tiny eyes on a butterfly’s wing. Rebirth is an idiot. Isolated Each into its own eternity, Like every pain, birth continues out of mind Deeper into the hill. Earth riots With levity. Darkness swims into light. Flowers begin to imagine the life of flowers. Heaven signals to me, pouring down shade Out of the canopy of trees, prying The sunlight apart from itself. Darkness And light are the same thing. Music moves Effortlessly between the two, made of nothing But wings, wings with eyes, no end in sight.
We shelter an angel whom we never cease to offend. We ought to be the guardians of that angel.

I came an errand one cloud-blowing evening To a slab-built, black-paper-covered house Of one room and one window and one door, The only dwelling in a waste cut over A hundred square miles round it in the mountains: And that not dwelt in now by men or women. (It never had been dwelt in, though, by women, So what is this I make a sorrow of?) I came as census-taker to the waste To count the people in it and found none, None in the hundred miles, none in the house, Where I came last with some hope, but not much, After hours’ overlooking from the cliffs An emptiness flayed to the very stone. I found no people that dared show themselves, None not in hiding from the outward eye. The time was autumn, but how anyone Could tell the time of year when every tree That could have dropped a leaf was down itself And nothing but the stump of it was left Now bringing out its rings in sugar of pitch; And every tree up stood a rotting trunk Without a single leaf to spend on autumn, Or branch to whistle after what was spent. Perhaps the wind the more without the help Of breathing trees said something of the time Of year or day the way it swung a door Forever off the latch, as if rude men Passed in and slammed it shut each one behind him For the next one to open for himself. I counted nine I had no right to count (But this was dreamy unofficial counting) Before I made the tenth across the threshold. Where was my supper? Where was anyone’s? No lamp was lit.

I came an errand one cloud-blowing evening
To a slab-built, black-paper-covered house
Of one room and one window and one door,
The only dwelling in a waste cut over
A hundred square miles round it in the mountains:
And that not dwelt in now by men or women.
(It never had been dwelt in, though, by women,
So what is this I make a sorrow of?)
I came as census-taker to the waste
To count the people in it and found none,
None in the hundred miles, none in the house,
Where I came last with some hope, but not much,
After hours’ overlooking from the cliffs
An emptiness flayed to the very stone.
I found no people that dared show themselves,
None not in hiding from the outward eye.
The time was autumn, but how anyone
Could tell the time of year when every tree
That could have dropped a leaf was down itself
And nothing but the stump of it was left
Now bringing out its rings in sugar of pitch;
And every tree up stood a rotting trunk
Without a single leaf to spend on autumn,
Or branch to whistle after what was spent.
Perhaps the wind the more without the help
Of breathing trees said something of the time
Of year or day the way it swung a door
Forever off the latch, as if rude men
Passed in and slammed it shut each one behind him
For the next one to open for himself.
I counted nine I had no right to count
(But this was dreamy unofficial counting)
Before I made the tenth across the threshold.
Where was my supper? Where was anyone’s?
No lamp was lit. Nothing was on the table.
The stove was cold—the stove was off the chimney—
And down by one side where it lacked a leg.
The people that had loudly passed the door
Were people to the ear but not the eye.
They were not on the table with their elbows.
They were not sleeping in the shelves of bunks.
I saw no men there and no bones of men there.
I armed myself against such bones as might be
With the pitch-blackened stub of an ax-handle
I picked up off the straw-dust covered floor.
Not bones, but the ill-fitted window rattled.
The door was still because I held it shut
While I thought what to do that could be done—
About the house—about the people not there.
This house in one year fallen to decay
Filled me with no less sorrow than the houses
Fallen to ruin in ten thousand years
Where Asia wedges Africa from Europe.
Nothing was left to do that I could see
Unless to find that there was no one there
And declare to the cliffs too far for echo,
“The place is desert, and let whoso lurks
In silence, if in this he is aggrieved,
Break silence now or be forever silent.
Let him say why it should not be declared so.”
The melancholy of having to count souls
Where they grow fewer and fewer every year
Is extreme where they shrink to none at all.
It must be I want life to go on living.

By Wallace Stevens
i         The World without Imagination Nota: man is the intelligence of his soil, The sovereign ghost. As such, the Socrates Of snails, musician of pears, principium And lex. Sed quaeritur: is this same wig Of things, this nincompated pedagogue, Preceptor to the sea? Crispin at sea Created, in his day, a touch of doubt. An eye most apt in gelatines and jupes, Berries of villages, a barber's eye, An eye of land, of simple salad-beds, Of honest quilts, the eye of Crispin, hung On porpoises, instead of apricots, And on silentious porpoises, whose snouts Dibbled in waves that were mustachios, Inscrutable hair in an inscrutable world. One eats one paté, even of salt, quotha. It was not so much the lost terrestrial, The snug hibernal from that sea and salt, That century of wind in a single puff. What counted was mythology of self, Blotched out beyond unblotching. Crispin, The lutanist of fleas, the knave, the thane, The ribboned stick, the bellowing breeches, cloak Of China, cap of Spain, imperative haw Of hum, inquisitorial botanist, And general lexicographer of mute And maidenly greenhorns, now beheld himself, A skinny sailor peering in the sea-glass. What word split up in clickering syllables And storming under multitudinous tones Was name for this short-shanks in all that brunt? Crispin was washed away by magnitude. The whole of life that still remained in him Dwindled to one sound strumming in his ear, Ubiquitous concussion, slap and sigh, Polyphony beyond his baton's thrust. Could Crispin stem verboseness in the sea, The old age of a watery realist, Triton, dissolved in shifting diaphanes Of blue and green? A wordy, watery age That whispered to the sun's compassion, made A convocation, nightly, of the sea-stars, And on the cropping foot-ways of the moon Lay grovelling. Triton incomplicate with that Which made him Triton, nothing left of him, Except in faint, memorial gesturings, That were like arms and shoulders in the waves, Here, something in the rise and fall of wind That seemed hallucinating horn, and here, A sunken voice, both of remembering And of forgetfulness, in alternate strain. Just so an ancient Crispin was dissolved. The valet in the tempest was annulled. Bordeaux to Yucatan, Havana next, And then to Carolina. Simple jaunt. Crispin, merest minuscule in the gates, Dejected his manner to the turbulence. The salt hung on his spirit like a frost, The dead brine melted in him like a dew Of winter, until nothing of himself Remained, except some starker, barer self In a starker, barer world, in which the sun Was not the sun because it never shone With bland complaisance on pale parasols, Beetled, in chapels, on the chaste bouquets. Against his pipping sounds a trumpet cried Celestial sneering boisterously. Crispin Became an introspective voyager. Here was the veritable ding an sich, at last, Crispin confronting it, a vocable thing, But with a speech belched out of hoary darks Noway resembling his, a visible thing, And excepting negligible Triton, free From the unavoidable shadow of himself That lay elsewhere around him. Severance Was clear. The last distortion of romance Forsook the insatiable egotist. The sea Severs not only lands but also selves. Here was no help before reality. Crispin beheld and Crispin was made new. The imagination, here, could not evade, In poems of plums, the strict austerity Of one vast, subjugating, final tone. The drenching of stale lives no more fell down. What was this gaudy, gusty panoply? Out of what swift destruction did it spring? It was caparison of mind and cloud And something given to make whole among The ruses that were shattered by the large.                                    iiConcerning the Thunderstorms of Yucatan In Yucatan, the Maya sonneteers Of the Caribbean amphitheatre, In spite of hawk and falcon, green toucan And jay, still to the night-bird made their plea, As if raspberry tanagers in palms, High up in orange air, were barbarous. But Crispin was too destitute to find In any commonplace the sought-for aid. He was a man made vivid by the sea, A man come out of luminous traversing, Much trumpeted, made desperately clear, Fresh from discoveries of tidal skies, To whom oracular rockings gave no rest. Into a savage color he went on. How greatly had he grown in his demesne, This auditor of insects! He that saw The stride of vanishing autumn in a park By way of decorous melancholy; he That wrote his couplet yearly to the spring, As dissertation of profound delight, Stopping, on voyage, in a land of snakes, Found his vicissitudes had much enlarged His apprehension, made him intricate In moody rucks, and difficult and strange In all desires, his destitution's mark. He was in this as other freemen are, Sonorous nutshells rattling inwardly. His violence was for aggrandizement And not for stupor, such as music makes For sleepers halfway waking. He perceived That coolness for his heat came suddenly, And only, in the fables that he scrawled With his own quill, in its indigenous dew, Of an aesthetic tough, diverse, untamed, Incredible to prudes, the mint of dirt, Green barbarism turning paradigm. Crispin foresaw a curious promenade Or, nobler, sensed an elemental fate, And elemental potencies and pangs, And beautiful barenesses as yet unseen, Making the most of savagery of palms, Of moonlight on the thick, cadaverous bloom That yuccas breed, and of the panther's tread. The fabulous and its intrinsic verse Came like two spirits parlaying, adorned In radiance from the Atlantic coign, For Crispin and his quill to catechize. But they came parlaying of such an earth, So thick with sides and jagged lops of green, So intertwined with serpent-kin encoiled Among the purple tufts, the scarlet crowns, Scenting the jungle in their refuges, So streaked with yellow, blue and green and red In beak and bud and fruity gobbet-skins, That earth was like a jostling festival Of seeds grown fat, too juicily opulent, Expanding in the gold's maternal warmth. So much for that. The affectionate emigrant found A new reality in parrot-squawks. Yet let that trifle pass. Now, as this odd Discoverer walked through the harbor streets Inspecting the cabildo, the façade Of the cathedral, making notes, he heard A rumbling, west of Mexico, it seemed, Approaching like a gasconade of drums. The white cabildo darkened, the façade, As sullen as the sky, was swallowed up In swift, successive shadows, dolefully. The rumbling broadened as it fell. The wind, Tempestuous clarion, with heavy cry, Came bluntly thundering, more terrible Than the revenge of music on bassoons. Gesticulating lightning, mystical, Made pallid flitter. Crispin, here, took flight. An annotator has his scruples, too. He knelt in the cathedral with the rest, This connoisseur of elemental fate, Aware of exquisite thought. The storm was one Of many proclamations of the kind, Proclaiming something harsher than he learned From hearing signboards whimper in cold nights Or seeing the midsummer artifice Of heat upon his pane. This was the span Of force, the quintessential fact, the note Of Vulcan, that a valet seeks to own, The thing that makes him envious in phrase. And while the torrent on the roof still droned He felt the Andean breath. His mind was free And more than free, elate, intent, profound And studious of a self possessing him, That was not in him in the crusty town From which he sailed. Beyond him, westward, lay The mountainous ridges, purple balustrades, In which the thunder, lapsing in its clap, Let down gigantic quavers of its voice, For Crispin to vociferate again.                                iii                 Approaching Carolina The book of moonlight is not written yet Nor half begun, but, when it is, leave room For Crispin, fagot in the lunar fire, Who, in the hubbub of his pilgrimage Through sweating changes, never could forget That wakefulness or meditating sleep, In which the sulky strophes willingly Bore up, in time, the somnolent, deep songs. Leave room, therefore, in that unwritten book For the legendary moonlight that once burned In Crispin's mind above a continent. America was always north to him, A northern west or western north, but north, And thereby polar, polar-purple, chilled And lank, rising and slumping from a sea Of hardy foam, receding flatly, spread In endless ledges, glittering, submerged And cold in a boreal mistiness of the moon. The spring came there in clinking pannicles Of half-dissolving frost, the summer came, If ever, whisked and wet, not ripening, Before the winter's vacancy returned. The myrtle, if the myrtle ever bloomed, Was like a glacial pink upon the air. The green palmettoes in crepuscular ice Clipped frigidly blue-black meridians, Morose chiaroscuro, gauntly drawn. How many poems he denied himself In his observant progress, lesser things Than the relentless contact he desired; How many sea-masks he ignored; what sounds He shut out from his tempering ear; what thoughts, Like jades affecting the sequestered bride; And what descants, he sent to banishment! Perhaps the Arctic moonlight really gave The liaison, the blissful liaison, Between himself and his environment, Which was, and is, chief motive, first delight, For him, and not for him alone. It seemed Elusive, faint, more mist than moon, perverse, Wrong as a divagation to Peking, To him that postulated as his theme The vulgar, as his theme and hymn and flight, A passionately niggling nightingale. Moonlight was an evasion, or, if not, A minor meeting, facile, delicate. Thus he conceived his voyaging to be An up and down between two elements, A fluctuating between sun and moon, A sally into gold and crimson forms, As on this voyage, out of goblinry, And then retirement like a turning back And sinking down to the indulgences That in the moonlight have their habitude. But let these backward lapses, if they would, Grind their seductions on him, Crispin knew It was a flourishing tropic he required For his refreshment, an abundant zone, Prickly and obdurate, dense, harmonious Yet with a harmony not rarefied Nor fined for the inhibited instruments Of over-civil stops. And thus he tossed Between a Carolina of old time, A little juvenile, an ancient whim, And the visible, circumspect presentment drawn From what he saw across his vessel's prow. He came. The poetic hero without palms Or jugglery, without regalia. And as he came he saw that it was spring, A time abhorrent to the nihilist Or searcher for the fecund minimum. The moonlight fiction disappeared. The spring, Although contending featly in its veils, Irised in dew and early fragrancies, Was gemmy marionette to him that sought A sinewy nakedness. A river bore The vessel inward. Tilting up his nose, He inhaled the rancid rosin, burly smells Of dampened lumber, emanations blown From warehouse doors, the gustiness of ropes, Decays of sacks, and all the arrant stinks That helped him round his rude aesthetic out. He savored rankness like a sensualist. He marked the marshy ground around the dock, The crawling railroad spur, the rotten fence, Curriculum for the marvellous sophomore. It purified. It made him see how much Of what he saw he never saw at all. He gripped more closely the essential prose As being, in a world so falsified, The one integrity for him, the one Discovery still possible to make, To which all poems were incident, unless That prose should wear a poem's guise at last.                             iv               The Idea of a Colony Nota: his soil is man's intelligence. That's better. That's worth crossing seas to find. Crispin in one laconic phrase laid bare His cloudy drift and planned a colony. Exit the mental moonlight, exit lex, Rex and principium, exit the whole Shebang. Exeunt omnes. Here was prose More exquisite than any tumbling verse: A still new continent in which to dwell. What was the purpose of his pilgrimage, Whatever shape it took in Crispin's mind, If not, when all is said, to drive away The shadow of his fellows from the skies, And, from their stale intelligence released, To make a new intelligence prevail? Hence the reverberations in the words Of his first central hymns, the celebrants Of rankest trivia, tests of the strength Of his aesthetic, his philosophy, The more invidious, the more desired. The florist asking aid from cabbages, The rich man going bare, the paladin Afraid, the blind man as astronomer, The appointed power unwielded from disdain. His western voyage ended and began. The torment of fastidious thought grew slack, Another, still more bellicose, came on. He, therefore, wrote his prolegomena, And, being full of the caprice, inscribed Commingled souvenirs and prophecies. He made a singular collation. Thus: The natives of the rain are rainy men. Although they paint effulgent, azure lakes, And April hillsides wooded white and pink, Their azure has a cloudy edge, their white And pink, the water bright that dogwood bears. And in their music showering sounds intone. On what strange froth does the gross Indian dote, What Eden sapling gum, what honeyed gore, What pulpy dram distilled of innocence, That streaking gold should speak in him Or bask within his images and words? If these rude instances impeach themselves By force of rudeness, let the principle Be plain. For application Crispin strove, Abhorring Turk as Esquimau, the lute As the marimba, the magnolia as rose. Upon these premises propounding, he Projected a colony that should extend To the dusk of a whistling south below the south. A comprehensive island hemisphere. The man in Georgia waking among pines Should be pine-spokesman. The responsive man, Planting his pristine cores in Florida, Should prick thereof, not on the psaltery, But on the banjo's categorical gut, Tuck tuck, while the flamingos flapped his bays. Sepulchral señors, bibbing pale mescal, Oblivious to the Aztec almanacs, Should make the intricate Sierra scan. And dark Brazilians in their cafés, Musing immaculate, pampean dits, Should scrawl a vigilant anthology, To be their latest, lucent paramour. These are the broadest instances. Crispin, Progenitor of such extensive scope, Was not indifferent to smart detail. The melon should have apposite ritual, Performed in verd apparel, and the peach, When its black branches came to bud, belle day, Should have an incantation. And again, When piled on salvers its aroma steeped The summer, it should have a sacrament And celebration. Shrewd novitiates Should be the clerks of our experience. These bland excursions into time to come, Related in romance to backward flights, However prodigal, however proud, Contained in their afflatus the reproach That first drove Crispin to his wandering. He could not be content with counterfeit, With masquerade of thought, with hapless words That must belie the racking masquerade, With fictive flourishes that preordained His passion's permit, hang of coat, degree Of buttons, measure of his salt. Such trash Might help the blind, not him, serenely sly. It irked beyond his patience. Hence it was, Preferring text to gloss, he humbly served Grotesque apprenticeship to chance event, A clown, perhaps, but an aspiring clown. There is a monotonous babbling in our dreams That makes them our dependent heirs, the heirs Of dreamers buried in our sleep, and not The oncoming fantasies of better birth. The apprentice knew these dreamers. If he dreamed Their dreams, he did it in a gingerly way. All dreams are vexing. Let them be expunged. But let the rabbit run, the cock declaim. Trinket pasticcio, flaunting skyey sheets, With Crispin as the tiptoe cozener? No, no: veracious page on page, exact.                                v                 A Nice Shady Home Crispin as hermit, pure and capable, Dwelt in the land. Perhaps if discontent Had kept him still the pricking realist, Choosing his element from droll confect Of was and is and shall or ought to be, Beyond Bordeaux, beyond Havana, far Beyond carked Yucatan, he might have come To colonize his polar planterdom And jig his chits upon a cloudy knee. But his emprize to that idea soon sped. Crispin dwelt in the land and dwelling there Slid from his continent by slow recess To things within his actual eye, alert To the difficulty of rebellious thought When the sky is blue. The blue infected will. It may be that the yarrow in his fields Sealed pensive purple under its concern. But day by day, now this thing and now that Confined him, while it cosseted, condoned, Little by little, as if the suzerain soil Abashed him by carouse to humble yet Attach. It seemed haphazard denouement. He first, as realist, admitted that Whoever hunts a matinal continent May, after all, stop short before a plum And be content and still be realist. The words of things entangle and confuse. The plum survives its poems. It may hang In the sunshine placidly, colored by ground Obliquities of those who pass beneath, Harlequined and mazily dewed and mauved In bloom. Yet it survives in its own form, Beyond these changes, good, fat, guzzly fruit. So Crispin hasped on the surviving form, For him, of shall or ought to be in is. Was he to bray this in profoundest brass Arointing his dreams with fugal requiems? Was he to company vastest things defunct With a blubber of tom-toms harrowing the sky? Scrawl a tragedian's testament? Prolong His active force in an inactive dirge, Which, let the tall musicians call and call, Should merely call him dead? Pronounce amen Through choirs infolded to the outmost clouds? Because he built a cabin who once planned Loquacious columns by the ructive sea? Because he turned to salad-beds again? Jovial Crispin, in calamitous crape? Should he lay by the personal and make Of his own fate an instance of all fate? What is one man among so many men? What are so many men in such a world? Can one man think one thing and think it long? Can one man be one thing and be it long? The very man despising honest quilts Lies quilted to his poll in his despite. For realists, what is is what should be. And so it came, his cabin shuffled up, His trees were planted, his duenna brought Her prismy blonde and clapped her in his hands, The curtains flittered and the door was closed. Crispin, magister of a single room, Latched up the night. So deep a sound fell down It was as if the solitude concealed And covered him and his congenial sleep. So deep a sound fell down it grew to be A long soothsaying silence down and down. The crickets beat their tambours in the wind, Marching a motionless march, custodians. In the presto of the morning, Crispin trod, Each day, still curious, but in a round Less prickly and much more condign than that He once thought necessary. Like Candide, Yeoman and grub, but with a fig in sight, And cream for the fig and silver for the cream, A blonde to tip the silver and to taste The rapey gouts. Good star, how that to be Annealed them in their cabin ribaldries! Yet the quotidian saps philosophers And men like Crispin like them in intent, If not in will, to track the knaves of thought. But the quotidian composed as his, Of breakfast ribands, fruits laid in their leaves, The tomtit and the cassia and the rose, Although the rose was not the noble thorn Of crinoline spread, but of a pining sweet, Composed of evenings like cracked shutters flung Upon the rumpling bottomness, and nights In which those frail custodians watched, Indifferent to the tepid summer cold, While he poured out upon the lips of her That lay beside him, the quotidian Like this, saps like the sun, true fortuner. For all it takes it gives a humped return Exchequering from piebald fiscs unkeyed.                               vi           And Daughters with Curls Portentous enunciation, syllable To blessed syllable affined, and sound Bubbling felicity in cantilene, Prolific and tormenting tenderness Of music, as it comes to unison, Forgather and bell boldly Crispin's last Deduction. Thrum, with a proud douceur His grand pronunciamento and devise. The chits came for his jigging, bluet-eyed, Hands without touch yet touching poignantly, Leaving no room upon his cloudy knee, Prophetic joint, for its diviner young. The return to social nature, once begun, Anabasis or slump, ascent or chute, Involved him in midwifery so dense His cabin counted as phylactery, Then place of vexing palankeens, then haunt Of children nibbling at the sugared void, Infants yet eminently old, then dome And halidom for the unbraided femes, Green crammers of the green fruits of the world, Bidders and biders for its ecstasies, True daughters both of Crispin and his clay. All this with many mulctings of the man, Effective colonizer sharply stopped In the door-yard by his own capacious bloom. But that this bloom grown riper, showing nibs Of its eventual roundness, puerile tints Of spiced and weathery rouges, should complex The stopper to indulgent fatalist Was unforeseen. First Crispin smiled upon His goldenest demoiselle, inhabitant, She seemed, of a country of the capuchins, So delicately blushed, so humbly eyed, Attentive to a coronal of things Secret and singular. Second, upon A second similar counterpart, a maid Most sisterly to the first, not yet awake Excepting to the motherly footstep, but Marvelling sometimes at the shaken sleep. Then third, a thing still flaxen in the light, A creeper under jaunty leaves. And fourth, Mere blusteriness that gewgaws jollified, All din and gobble, blasphemously pink. A few years more and the vermeil capuchin Gave to the cabin, lordlier than it was, The dulcet omen fit for such a house. The second sister dallying was shy To fetch the one full-pinioned one himself Out of her botches, hot embosomer. The third one gaping at the orioles Lettered herself demurely as became A pearly poetess, peaked for rhapsody. The fourth, pent now, a digit curious. Four daughters in a world too intricate In the beginning, four blithe instruments Of differing struts, four voices several In couch, four more personæ, intimate As buffo, yet divers, four mirrors blue That should be silver, four accustomed seeds Hinting incredible hues, four self-same lights That spread chromatics in hilarious dark, Four questioners and four sure answerers. Crispin concocted doctrine from the rout. The world, a turnip once so readily plucked, Sacked up and carried overseas, daubed out Of its ancient purple, pruned to the fertile main, And sown again by the stiffest realist, Came reproduced in purple, family font, The same insoluble lump. The fatalist Stepped in and dropped the chuckling down his craw, Without grace or grumble. Score this anecdote Invented for its pith, not doctrinal In form though in design, as Crispin willed, Disguised pronunciamento, summary, Autumn's compendium, strident in itself But muted, mused, and perfectly revolved In those portentous accents, syllables, And sounds of music coming to accord Upon his law, like their inherent sphere, Seraphic proclamations of the pure Delivered with a deluging onwardness. Or if the music sticks, if the anecdote Is false, if Crispin is a profitless Philosopher, beginning with green brag, Concluding fadedly, if as a man Prone to distemper he abates in taste, Fickle and fumbling, variable, obscure, Glozing his life with after-shining flicks, Illuminating, from a fancy gorged By apparition, plain and common things, Sequestering the fluster from the year, Making gulped potions from obstreperous drops, And so distorting, proving what he proves Is nothing, what can all this matter since The relation comes, benignly, to its end? So may the relation of each man be clipped.
i         The World without Imagination Nota: man is the intelligence of his soil, The sovereign ghost. As such, the Socrates Of snails, musician of pears, principium And lex. Sed quaeritur: is this same wig Of things, this nincompated pedagogue, Preceptor to the sea? Crispin at sea Created, in his day, a touch of doubt. An eye most apt in gelatines and jupes, Berries of villages, a barber's eye, An eye of land, of simple salad-beds, Of honest quilts, the eye of Crispin, hung On porpoises, instead of apricots, And on silentious porpoises, whose snouts Dibbled in waves that were mustachios, Inscrutable hair in an inscrutable world. One eats one paté, even of salt, quotha. It was not so much the lost terrestrial, The snug hibernal from that sea and salt, That century of wind in a single puff. What counted was mythology of self, Blotched out beyond unblotching. Crispin, The lutanist of fleas, the knave, the thane, The ribboned stick, the bellowing breeches, cloak Of China, cap of Spain, imperative haw Of hum, inquisitorial botanist, And general lexicographer of mute And maidenly greenhorns, now beheld himself, A skinny sailor peering in the sea-glass. What word split up in clickering syllables And storming under multitudinous tones Was name for this short-shanks in all that brunt? Crispin was washed away by magnitude. The whole of life that still remained in him Dwindled to one sound strumming in his ear, Ubiquitous concussion, slap and sigh, Polyphony beyond his baton's thrust. Could Crispin stem verboseness in the sea, The old age of a watery realist, Triton, dissolved in shifting diaphanes Of blue and green? A wordy, watery age That whispered to the sun's compassion, made A convocation, nightly, of the sea-stars, And on the cropping foot-ways of the moon Lay grovelling. Triton incomplicate with that Which made him Triton, nothing left of him, Except in faint, memorial gesturings, That were like arms and shoulders in the waves, Here, something in the rise and fall of wind That seemed hallucinating horn, and here, A sunken voice, both of remembering And of forgetfulness, in alternate strain. Just so an ancient Crispin was dissolved. The valet in the tempest was annulled. Bordeaux to Yucatan, Havana next, And then to Carolina. Simple jaunt. Crispin, merest minuscule in the gates, Dejected his manner to the turbulence. The salt hung on his spirit like a frost, The dead brine melted in him like a dew Of winter, until nothing of himself Remained, except some starker, barer self In a starker, barer world, in which the sun Was not the sun because it never shone With bland complaisance on pale parasols, Beetled, in chapels, on the chaste bouquets. Against his pipping sounds a trumpet cried Celestial sneering boisterously. Crispin Became an introspective voyager. Here was the veritable ding an sich, at last, Crispin confronting it, a vocable thing, But with a speech belched out of hoary darks Noway resembling his, a visible thing, And excepting negligible Triton, free From the unavoidable shadow of himself That lay elsewhere around him. Severance Was clear. The last distortion of romance Forsook the insatiable egotist. The sea Severs not only lands but also selves. Here was no help before reality. Crispin beheld and Crispin was made new. The imagination, here, could not evade, In poems of plums, the strict austerity Of one vast, subjugating, final tone. The drenching of stale lives no more fell down. What was this gaudy, gusty panoply? Out of what swift destruction did it spring? It was caparison of mind and cloud And something given to make whole among The ruses that were shattered by the large.                                    iiConcerning the Thunderstorms of Yucatan In Yucatan, the Maya sonneteers Of the Caribbean amphitheatre, In spite of hawk and falcon, green toucan And jay, still to the night-bird made their plea, As if raspberry tanagers in palms, High up in orange air, were barbarous. But Crispin was too destitute to find In any commonplace the sought-for aid. He was a man made vivid by the sea, A man come out of luminous traversing, Much trumpeted, made desperately clear, Fresh from discoveries of tidal skies, To whom oracular rockings gave no rest. Into a savage color he went on. How greatly had he grown in his demesne, This auditor of insects! He that saw The stride of vanishing autumn in a park By way of decorous melancholy; he That wrote his couplet yearly to the spring, As dissertation of profound delight, Stopping, on voyage, in a land of snakes, Found his vicissitudes had much enlarged His apprehension, made him intricate In moody rucks, and difficult and strange In all desires, his destitution's mark. He was in this as other freemen are, Sonorous nutshells rattling inwardly. His violence was for aggrandizement And not for stupor, such as music makes For sleepers halfway waking. He perceived That coolness for his heat came suddenly, And only, in the fables that he scrawled With his own quill, in its indigenous dew, Of an aesthetic tough, diverse, untamed, Incredible to prudes, the mint of dirt, Green barbarism turning paradigm. Crispin foresaw a curious promenade Or, nobler, sensed an elemental fate, And elemental potencies and pangs, And beautiful barenesses as yet unseen, Making the most of savagery of palms, Of moonlight on the thick, cadaverous bloom That yuccas breed, and of the panther's tread. The fabulous and its intrinsic verse Came like two spirits parlaying, adorned In radiance from the Atlantic coign, For Crispin and his quill to catechize. But they came parlaying of such an earth, So thick with sides and jagged lops of green, So intertwined with serpent-kin encoiled Among the purple tufts, the scarlet crowns, Scenting the jungle in their refuges, So streaked with yellow, blue and green and red In beak and bud and fruity gobbet-skins, That earth was like a jostling festival Of seeds grown fat, too juicily opulent, Expanding in the gold's maternal warmth. So much for that. The affectionate emigrant found A new reality in parrot-squawks. Yet let that trifle pass. Now, as this odd Discoverer walked through the harbor streets Inspecting the cabildo, the façade Of the cathedral, making notes, he heard A rumbling, west of Mexico, it seemed, Approaching like a gasconade of drums. The white cabildo darkened, the façade, As sullen as the sky, was swallowed up In swift, successive shadows, dolefully. The rumbling broadened as it fell. The wind, Tempestuous clarion, with heavy cry, Came bluntly thundering, more terrible Than the revenge of music on bassoons. Gesticulating lightning, mystical, Made pallid flitter. Crispin, here, took flight. An annotator has his scruples, too. He knelt in the cathedral with the rest, This connoisseur of elemental fate, Aware of exquisite thought. The storm was one Of many proclamations of the kind, Proclaiming something harsher than he learned From hearing signboards whimper in cold nights Or seeing the midsummer artifice Of heat upon his pane. This was the span Of force, the quintessential fact, the note Of Vulcan, that a valet seeks to own, The thing that makes him envious in phrase. And while the torrent on the roof still droned He felt the Andean breath. His mind was free And more than free, elate, intent, profound And studious of a self possessing him, That was not in him in the crusty town From which he sailed. Beyond him, westward, lay The mountainous ridges, purple balustrades, In which the thunder, lapsing in its clap, Let down gigantic quavers of its voice, For Crispin to vociferate again.                                iii                 Approaching Carolina The book of moonlight is not written yet Nor half begun, but, when it is, leave room For Crispin, fagot in the lunar fire, Who, in the hubbub of his pilgrimage Through sweating changes, never could forget That wakefulness or meditating sleep, In which the sulky strophes willingly Bore up, in time, the somnolent, deep songs. Leave room, therefore, in that unwritten book For the legendary moonlight that once burned In Crispin's mind above a continent. America was always north to him, A northern west or western north, but north, And thereby polar, polar-purple, chilled And lank, rising and slumping from a sea Of hardy foam, receding flatly, spread In endless ledges, glittering, submerged And cold in a boreal mistiness of the moon. The spring came there in clinking pannicles Of half-dissolving frost, the summer came, If ever, whisked and wet, not ripening, Before the winter's vacancy returned. The myrtle, if the myrtle ever bloomed, Was like a glacial pink upon the air. The green palmettoes in crepuscular ice Clipped frigidly blue-black meridians, Morose chiaroscuro, gauntly drawn. How many poems he denied himself In his observant progress, lesser things Than the relentless contact he desired; How many sea-masks he ignored; what sounds He shut out from his tempering ear; what thoughts, Like jades affecting the sequestered bride; And what descants, he sent to banishment! Perhaps the Arctic moonlight really gave The liaison, the blissful liaison, Between himself and his environment, Which was, and is, chief motive, first delight, For him, and not for him alone. It seemed Elusive, faint, more mist than moon, perverse, Wrong as a divagation to Peking, To him that postulated as his theme The vulgar, as his theme and hymn and flight, A passionately niggling nightingale. Moonlight was an evasion, or, if not, A minor meeting, facile, delicate. Thus he conceived his voyaging to be An up and down between two elements, A fluctuating between sun and moon, A sally into gold and crimson forms, As on this voyage, out of goblinry, And then retirement like a turning back And sinking down to the indulgences That in the moonlight have their habitude. But let these backward lapses, if they would, Grind their seductions on him, Crispin knew It was a flourishing tropic he required For his refreshment, an abundant zone, Prickly and obdurate, dense, harmonious Yet with a harmony not rarefied Nor fined for the inhibited instruments Of over-civil stops. And thus he tossed Between a Carolina of old time, A little juvenile, an ancient whim, And the visible, circumspect presentment drawn From what he saw across his vessel's prow. He came. The poetic hero without palms Or jugglery, without regalia. And as he came he saw that it was spring, A time abhorrent to the nihilist Or searcher for the fecund minimum. The moonlight fiction disappeared. The spring, Although contending featly in its veils, Irised in dew and early fragrancies, Was gemmy marionette to him that sought A sinewy nakedness. A river bore The vessel inward. Tilting up his nose, He inhaled the rancid rosin, burly smells Of dampened lumber, emanations blown From warehouse doors, the gustiness of ropes, Decays of sacks, and all the arrant stinks That helped him round his rude aesthetic out. He savored rankness like a sensualist. He marked the marshy ground around the dock, The crawling railroad spur, the rotten fence, Curriculum for the marvellous sophomore. It purified.

That's worth crossing seas to find. Crispin in one laconic phrase laid bare His cloudy drift and planned a colony. Exit the mental moonlight, exit lex, Rex and principium, exit the whole Shebang. Exeunt omnes. Here was prose More exquisite than any tumbling verse: A still new continent in which to dwell. What was the purpose of his pilgrimage, Whatever shape it took in Crispin's mind, If not, when all is said, to drive away The shadow of his fellows from the skies, And, from their stale intelligence released, To make a new intelligence prevail? Hence the reverberations in the words Of his first central hymns, the celebrants Of rankest trivia, tests of the strength Of his aesthetic, his philosophy, The more invidious, the more desired. The florist asking aid from cabbages, The rich man going bare, the paladin Afraid, the blind man as astronomer, The appointed power unwielded from disdain. His western voyage ended and began. The torment of fastidious thought grew slack, Another, still more bellicose, came on. He, therefore, wrote his prolegomena, And, being full of the caprice, inscribed Commingled souvenirs and prophecies. He made a singular collation.

Yet it survives in its own form, Beyond these changes, good, fat, guzzly fruit. So Crispin hasped on the surviving form, For him, of shall or ought to be in is. Was he to bray this in profoundest brass Arointing his dreams with fugal requiems? Was he to company vastest things defunct With a blubber of tom-toms harrowing the sky? Scrawl a tragedian's testament? Prolong His active force in an inactive dirge, Which, let the tall musicians call and call, Should merely call him dead? Pronounce amen Through choirs infolded to the outmost clouds? Because he built a cabin who once planned Loquacious columns by the ructive sea? Because he turned to salad-beds again? Jovial Crispin, in calamitous crape? Should he lay by the personal and make Of his own fate an instance of all fate? What is one man among so many men? What are so many men in such a world? Can one man think one thing and think it long? Can one man be one thing and be it long? The very man despising honest quilts Lies quilted to his poll in his despite. For realists, what is is what should be. And so it came, his cabin shuffled up, His trees were planted, his duenna brought Her prismy blonde and clapped her in his hands, The curtains flittered and the door was closed. Crispin, magister of a single room, Latched up the night. So deep a sound fell down It was as if the solitude concealed And covered him and his congenial sleep. So deep a sound fell down it grew to be A long soothsaying silence down and down. The crickets beat their tambours in the wind, Marching a motionless march, custodians. In the presto of the morning, Crispin trod, Each day, still curious, but in a round Less prickly and much more condign than that He once thought necessary. Like Candide, Yeoman and grub, but with a fig in sight, And cream for the fig and silver for the cream, A blonde to tip the silver and to taste The rapey gouts. Good star, how that to be Annealed them in their cabin ribaldries! Yet the quotidian saps philosophers And men like Crispin like them in intent, If not in will, to track the knaves of thought. But the quotidian composed as his, Of breakfast ribands, fruits laid in their leaves, The tomtit and the cassia and the rose, Although the rose was not the noble thorn Of crinoline spread, but of a pining sweet, Composed of evenings like cracked shutters flung Upon the rumpling bottomness, and nights In which those frail custodians watched, Indifferent to the tepid summer cold, While he poured out upon the lips of her That lay beside him, the quotidian Like this, saps like the sun, true fortuner. For all it takes it gives a humped return Exchequering from piebald fiscs unkeyed.                               vi           And Daughters with Curls Portentous enunciation, syllable To blessed syllable affined, and sound Bubbling felicity in cantilene, Prolific and tormenting tenderness Of music, as it comes to unison, Forgather and bell boldly Crispin's last Deduction. Thrum, with a proud douceur His grand pronunciamento and devise. The chits came for his jigging, bluet-eyed, Hands without touch yet touching poignantly, Leaving no room upon his cloudy knee, Prophetic joint, for its diviner young. The return to social nature, once begun, Anabasis or slump, ascent or chute, Involved him in midwifery so dense His cabin counted as phylactery, Then place of vexing palankeens, then haunt Of children nibbling at the sugared void, Infants yet eminently old, then dome And halidom for the unbraided femes, Green crammers of the green fruits of the world, Bidders and biders for its ecstasies, True daughters both of Crispin and his clay. All this with many mulctings of the man, Effective colonizer sharply stopped In the door-yard by his own capacious bloom. But that this bloom grown riper, showing nibs Of its eventual roundness, puerile tints Of spiced and weathery rouges, should complex The stopper to indulgent fatalist Was unforeseen. First Crispin smiled upon His goldenest demoiselle, inhabitant, She seemed, of a country of the capuchins, So delicately blushed, so humbly eyed, Attentive to a coronal of things Secret and singular. Second, upon A second similar counterpart, a maid Most sisterly to the first, not yet awake Excepting to the motherly footstep, but Marvelling sometimes at the shaken sleep. Then third, a thing still flaxen in the light, A creeper under jaunty leaves. And fourth, Mere blusteriness that gewgaws jollified, All din and gobble, blasphemously pink. A few years more and the vermeil capuchin Gave to the cabin, lordlier than it was, The dulcet omen fit for such a house. The second sister dallying was shy To fetch the one full-pinioned one himself Out of her botches, hot embosomer. The third one gaping at the orioles Lettered herself demurely as became A pearly poetess, peaked for rhapsody. The fourth, pent now, a digit curious. Four daughters in a world too intricate In the beginning, four blithe instruments Of differing struts, four voices several In couch, four more personæ, intimate As buffo, yet divers, four mirrors blue That should be silver, four accustomed seeds Hinting incredible hues, four self-same lights That spread chromatics in hilarious dark, Four questioners and four sure answerers. Crispin concocted doctrine from the rout. The world, a turnip once so readily plucked, Sacked up and carried overseas, daubed out Of its ancient purple, pruned to the fertile main, And sown again by the stiffest realist, Came reproduced in purple, family font, The same insoluble lump. The fatalist Stepped in and dropped the chuckling down his craw, Without grace or grumble. Score this anecdote Invented for its pith, not doctrinal In form though in design, as Crispin willed, Disguised pronunciamento, summary, Autumn's compendium, strident in itself But muted, mused, and perfectly revolved In those portentous accents, syllables, And sounds of music coming to accord Upon his law, like their inherent sphere, Seraphic proclamations of the pure Delivered with a deluging onwardness. Or if the music sticks, if the anecdote Is false, if Crispin is a profitless Philosopher, beginning with green brag, Concluding fadedly, if as a man Prone to distemper he abates in taste, Fickle and fumbling, variable, obscure, Glozing his life with after-shining flicks, Illuminating, from a fancy gorged By apparition, plain and common things, Sequestering the fluster from the year, Making gulped potions from obstreperous drops, And so distorting, proving what he proves Is nothing, what can all this matter since The relation comes, benignly, to its end? So may the relation of each man be clipped.
i
The World without Imagination

Nota: man is the intelligence of his soil,
The sovereign ghost. As such, the Socrates
Of snails, musician of pears, principium
And lex. Sed quaeritur: is this same wig
Of things, this nincompated pedagogue,
Preceptor to the sea? Crispin at sea
Created, in his day, a touch of doubt.
An eye most apt in gelatines and jupes,
Berries of villages, a barber's eye,
An eye of land, of simple salad-beds,
Of honest quilts, the eye of Crispin, hung
On porpoises, instead of apricots,
And on silentious porpoises, whose snouts
Dibbled in waves that were mustachios,
Inscrutable hair in an inscrutable world.

One eats one paté, even of salt, quotha.
It was not so much the lost terrestrial,
The snug hibernal from that sea and salt,
That century of wind in a single puff.
What counted was mythology of self,
Blotched out beyond unblotching. Crispin,
The lutanist of fleas, the knave, the thane,
The ribboned stick, the bellowing breeches, cloak
Of China, cap of Spain, imperative haw
Of hum, inquisitorial botanist,
And general lexicographer of mute
And maidenly greenhorns, now beheld himself,
A skinny sailor peering in the sea-glass.
What word split up in clickering syllables
And storming under multitudinous tones
Was name for this short-shanks in all that brunt?
Crispin was washed away by magnitude.
The whole of life that still remained in him
Dwindled to one sound strumming in his ear,
Ubiquitous concussion, slap and sigh,
Polyphony beyond his baton's thrust.

Could Crispin stem verboseness in the sea,
The old age of a watery realist,
Triton, dissolved in shifting diaphanes
Of blue and green? A wordy, watery age
That whispered to the sun's compassion, made
A convocation, nightly, of the sea-stars,
And on the cropping foot-ways of the moon
Lay grovelling. Triton incomplicate with that
Which made him Triton, nothing left of him,
Except in faint, memorial gesturings,
That were like arms and shoulders in the waves,
Here, something in the rise and fall of wind
That seemed hallucinating horn, and here,
A sunken voice, both of remembering
And of forgetfulness, in alternate strain.
Just so an ancient Crispin was dissolved.
The valet in the tempest was annulled.
Bordeaux to Yucatan, Havana next,
And then to Carolina. Simple jaunt.
Crispin, merest minuscule in the gates,
Dejected his manner to the turbulence.
The salt hung on his spirit like a frost,
The dead brine melted in him like a dew
Of winter, until nothing of himself
Remained, except some starker, barer self
In a starker, barer world, in which the sun
Was not the sun because it never shone
With bland complaisance on pale parasols,
Beetled, in chapels, on the chaste bouquets.
Against his pipping sounds a trumpet cried
Celestial sneering boisterously. Crispin
Became an introspective voyager.

Here was the veritable ding an sich, at last,
Crispin confronting it, a vocable thing,
But with a speech belched out of hoary darks
Noway resembling his, a visible thing,
And excepting negligible Triton, free
From the unavoidable shadow of himself
That lay elsewhere around him. Severance
Was clear. The last distortion of romance
Forsook the insatiable egotist. The sea
Severs not only lands but also selves.
Here was no help before reality.
Crispin beheld and Crispin was made new.
The imagination, here, could not evade,
In poems of plums, the strict austerity
Of one vast, subjugating, final tone.
The drenching of stale lives no more fell down.
What was this gaudy, gusty panoply?
Out of what swift destruction did it spring?
It was caparison of mind and cloud
And something given to make whole among
The ruses that were shattered by the large.

ii
Concerning the Thunderstorms of Yucatan

In Yucatan, the Maya sonneteers
Of the Caribbean amphitheatre,
In spite of hawk and falcon, green toucan
And jay, still to the night-bird made their plea,
As if raspberry tanagers in palms,
High up in orange air, were barbarous.
But Crispin was too destitute to find
In any commonplace the sought-for aid.
He was a man made vivid by the sea,
A man come out of luminous traversing,
Much trumpeted, made desperately clear,
Fresh from discoveries of tidal skies,
To whom oracular rockings gave no rest.
Into a savage color he went on.

How greatly had he grown in his demesne,
This auditor of insects! He that saw
The stride of vanishing autumn in a park
By way of decorous melancholy; he
That wrote his couplet yearly to the spring,
As dissertation of profound delight,
Stopping, on voyage, in a land of snakes,
Found his vicissitudes had much enlarged
His apprehension, made him intricate
In moody rucks, and difficult and strange
In all desires, his destitution's mark.
He was in this as other freemen are,
Sonorous nutshells rattling inwardly.
His violence was for aggrandizement
And not for stupor, such as music makes
For sleepers halfway waking. He perceived
That coolness for his heat came suddenly,
And only, in the fables that he scrawled
With his own quill, in its indigenous dew,
Of an aesthetic tough, diverse, untamed,
Incredible to prudes, the mint of dirt,
Green barbarism turning paradigm.
Crispin foresaw a curious promenade
Or, nobler, sensed an elemental fate,
And elemental potencies and pangs,
And beautiful barenesses as yet unseen,
Making the most of savagery of palms,
Of moonlight on the thick, cadaverous bloom
That yuccas breed, and of the panther's tread.
The fabulous and its intrinsic verse
Came like two spirits parlaying, adorned
In radiance from the Atlantic coign,
For Crispin and his quill to catechize.
But they came parlaying of such an earth,
So thick with sides and jagged lops of green,
So intertwined with serpent-kin encoiled
Among the purple tufts, the scarlet crowns,
Scenting the jungle in their refuges,
So streaked with yellow, blue and green and red
In beak and bud and fruity gobbet-skins,
That earth was like a jostling festival
Of seeds grown fat, too juicily opulent,
Expanding in the gold's maternal warmth.
So much for that. The affectionate emigrant found
A new reality in parrot-squawks.
Yet let that trifle pass. Now, as this odd
Discoverer walked through the harbor streets
Inspecting the cabildo, the façade
Of the cathedral, making notes, he heard
A rumbling, west of Mexico, it seemed,
Approaching like a gasconade of drums.
The white cabildo darkened, the façade,
As sullen as the sky, was swallowed up
In swift, successive shadows, dolefully.
The rumbling broadened as it fell. The wind,
Tempestuous clarion, with heavy cry,
Came bluntly thundering, more terrible
Than the revenge of music on bassoons.
Gesticulating lightning, mystical,
Made pallid flitter. Crispin, here, took flight.
An annotator has his scruples, too.
He knelt in the cathedral with the rest,
This connoisseur of elemental fate,
Aware of exquisite thought. The storm was one
Of many proclamations of the kind,
Proclaiming something harsher than he learned
From hearing signboards whimper in cold nights
Or seeing the midsummer artifice
Of heat upon his pane. This was the span
Of force, the quintessential fact, the note
Of Vulcan, that a valet seeks to own,
The thing that makes him envious in phrase.

And while the torrent on the roof still droned
He felt the Andean breath. His mind was free
And more than free, elate, intent, profound
And studious of a self possessing him,
That was not in him in the crusty town
From which he sailed. Beyond him, westward, lay
The mountainous ridges, purple balustrades,
In which the thunder, lapsing in its clap,
Let down gigantic quavers of its voice,
For Crispin to vociferate again.


iii
Approaching Carolina

The book of moonlight is not written yet
Nor half begun, but, when it is, leave room
For Crispin, fagot in the lunar fire,
Who, in the hubbub of his pilgrimage
Through sweating changes, never could forget
That wakefulness or meditating sleep,
In which the sulky strophes willingly
Bore up, in time, the somnolent, deep songs.
Leave room, therefore, in that unwritten book
For the legendary moonlight that once burned
In Crispin's mind above a continent.
America was always north to him,
A northern west or western north, but north,
And thereby polar, polar-purple, chilled
And lank, rising and slumping from a sea
Of hardy foam, receding flatly, spread
In endless ledges, glittering, submerged
And cold in a boreal mistiness of the moon.
The spring came there in clinking pannicles
Of half-dissolving frost, the summer came,
If ever, whisked and wet, not ripening,
Before the winter's vacancy returned.
The myrtle, if the myrtle ever bloomed,
Was like a glacial pink upon the air.
The green palmettoes in crepuscular ice
Clipped frigidly blue-black meridians,
Morose chiaroscuro, gauntly drawn.

How many poems he denied himself
In his observant progress, lesser things
Than the relentless contact he desired;
How many sea-masks he ignored; what sounds
He shut out from his tempering ear; what thoughts,
Like jades affecting the sequestered bride;
And what descants, he sent to banishment!
Perhaps the Arctic moonlight really gave
The liaison, the blissful liaison,
Between himself and his environment,
Which was, and is, chief motive, first delight,
For him, and not for him alone. It seemed
Elusive, faint, more mist than moon, perverse,
Wrong as a divagation to Peking,
To him that postulated as his theme
The vulgar, as his theme and hymn and flight,
A passionately niggling nightingale.
Moonlight was an evasion, or, if not,
A minor meeting, facile, delicate.

Thus he conceived his voyaging to be
An up and down between two elements,
A fluctuating between sun and moon,
A sally into gold and crimson forms,
As on this voyage, out of goblinry,
And then retirement like a turning back
And sinking down to the indulgences
That in the moonlight have their habitude.
But let these backward lapses, if they would,
Grind their seductions on him, Crispin knew
It was a flourishing tropic he required
For his refreshment, an abundant zone,
Prickly and obdurate, dense, harmonious
Yet with a harmony not rarefied
Nor fined for the inhibited instruments
Of over-civil stops. And thus he tossed
Between a Carolina of old time,
A little juvenile, an ancient whim,
And the visible, circumspect presentment drawn
From what he saw across his vessel's prow.

He came. The poetic hero without palms
Or jugglery, without regalia.
And as he came he saw that it was spring,
A time abhorrent to the nihilist
Or searcher for the fecund minimum.
The moonlight fiction disappeared. The spring,
Although contending featly in its veils,
Irised in dew and early fragrancies,
Was gemmy marionette to him that sought
A sinewy nakedness. A river bore
The vessel inward. Tilting up his nose,
He inhaled the rancid rosin, burly smells
Of dampened lumber, emanations blown
From warehouse doors, the gustiness of ropes,
Decays of sacks, and all the arrant stinks
That helped him round his rude aesthetic out.
He savored rankness like a sensualist.
He marked the marshy ground around the dock,
The crawling railroad spur, the rotten fence,
Curriculum for the marvellous sophomore.
It purified. It made him see how much
Of what he saw he never saw at all.
He gripped more closely the essential prose
As being, in a world so falsified,
The one integrity for him, the one
Discovery still possible to make,
To which all poems were incident, unless
That prose should wear a poem's guise at last.

iv
The Idea of a Colony

Nota: his soil is man's intelligence.
That's better. That's worth crossing seas to find.
Crispin in one laconic phrase laid bare
His cloudy drift and planned a colony.
Exit the mental moonlight, exit lex,
Rex and principium, exit the whole
Shebang. Exeunt omnes. Here was prose
More exquisite than any tumbling verse:
A still new continent in which to dwell.
What was the purpose of his pilgrimage,
Whatever shape it took in Crispin's mind,
If not, when all is said, to drive away
The shadow of his fellows from the skies,
And, from their stale intelligence released,
To make a new intelligence prevail?
Hence the reverberations in the words
Of his first central hymns, the celebrants
Of rankest trivia, tests of the strength
Of his aesthetic, his philosophy,
The more invidious, the more desired.
The florist asking aid from cabbages,
The rich man going bare, the paladin
Afraid, the blind man as astronomer,
The appointed power unwielded from disdain.
His western voyage ended and began.
The torment of fastidious thought grew slack,
Another, still more bellicose, came on.
He, therefore, wrote his prolegomena,
And, being full of the caprice, inscribed
Commingled souvenirs and prophecies.
He made a singular collation. Thus:
The natives of the rain are rainy men.
Although they paint effulgent, azure lakes,
And April hillsides wooded white and pink,
Their azure has a cloudy edge, their white
And pink, the water bright that dogwood bears.
And in their music showering sounds intone.
On what strange froth does the gross Indian dote,
What Eden sapling gum, what honeyed gore,
What pulpy dram distilled of innocence,
That streaking gold should speak in him
Or bask within his images and words?
If these rude instances impeach themselves
By force of rudeness, let the principle
Be plain. For application Crispin strove,
Abhorring Turk as Esquimau, the lute
As the marimba, the magnolia as rose.

Upon these premises propounding, he
Projected a colony that should extend
To the dusk of a whistling south below the south.
A comprehensive island hemisphere.
The man in Georgia waking among pines
Should be pine-spokesman. The responsive man,
Planting his pristine cores in Florida,
Should prick thereof, not on the psaltery,
But on the banjo's categorical gut,
Tuck tuck, while the flamingos flapped his bays.
Sepulchral señors, bibbing pale mescal,
Oblivious to the Aztec almanacs,
Should make the intricate Sierra scan.
And dark Brazilians in their cafés,
Musing immaculate, pampean dits,
Should scrawl a vigilant anthology,
To be their latest, lucent paramour.
These are the broadest instances. Crispin,
Progenitor of such extensive scope,
Was not indifferent to smart detail.
The melon should have apposite ritual,
Performed in verd apparel, and the peach,
When its black branches came to bud, belle day,
Should have an incantation. And again,
When piled on salvers its aroma steeped
The summer, it should have a sacrament
And celebration. Shrewd novitiates
Should be the clerks of our experience.

These bland excursions into time to come,
Related in romance to backward flights,
However prodigal, however proud,
Contained in their afflatus the reproach
That first drove Crispin to his wandering.
He could not be content with counterfeit,
With masquerade of thought, with hapless words
That must belie the racking masquerade,
With fictive flourishes that preordained
His passion's permit, hang of coat, degree
Of buttons, measure of his salt. Such trash
Might help the blind, not him, serenely sly.
It irked beyond his patience. Hence it was,
Preferring text to gloss, he humbly served
Grotesque apprenticeship to chance event,
A clown, perhaps, but an aspiring clown.
There is a monotonous babbling in our dreams
That makes them our dependent heirs, the heirs
Of dreamers buried in our sleep, and not
The oncoming fantasies of better birth.
The apprentice knew these dreamers. If he dreamed
Their dreams, he did it in a gingerly way.
All dreams are vexing. Let them be expunged.
But let the rabbit run, the cock declaim.

Trinket pasticcio, flaunting skyey sheets,
With Crispin as the tiptoe cozener?
No, no: veracious page on page, exact.

v
A Nice Shady Home

Crispin as hermit, pure and capable,
Dwelt in the land. Perhaps if discontent
Had kept him still the pricking realist,
Choosing his element from droll confect
Of was and is and shall or ought to be,
Beyond Bordeaux, beyond Havana, far
Beyond carked Yucatan, he might have come
To colonize his polar planterdom
And jig his chits upon a cloudy knee.
But his emprize to that idea soon sped.
Crispin dwelt in the land and dwelling there
Slid from his continent by slow recess
To things within his actual eye, alert
To the difficulty of rebellious thought
When the sky is blue. The blue infected will.
It may be that the yarrow in his fields
Sealed pensive purple under its concern.
But day by day, now this thing and now that
Confined him, while it cosseted, condoned,
Little by little, as if the suzerain soil
Abashed him by carouse to humble yet
Attach. It seemed haphazard denouement.
He first, as realist, admitted that
Whoever hunts a matinal continent
May, after all, stop short before a plum
And be content and still be realist.
The words of things entangle and confuse.
The plum survives its poems. It may hang
In the sunshine placidly, colored by ground
Obliquities of those who pass beneath,
Harlequined and mazily dewed and mauved
In bloom. Yet it survives in its own form,
Beyond these changes, good, fat, guzzly fruit.
So Crispin hasped on the surviving form,
For him, of shall or ought to be in is.

Was he to bray this in profoundest brass
Arointing his dreams with fugal requiems?
Was he to company vastest things defunct
With a blubber of tom-toms harrowing the sky?
Scrawl a tragedian's testament? Prolong
His active force in an inactive dirge,
Which, let the tall musicians call and call,
Should merely call him dead? Pronounce amen
Through choirs infolded to the outmost clouds?
Because he built a cabin who once planned
Loquacious columns by the ructive sea?
Because he turned to salad-beds again?
Jovial Crispin, in calamitous crape?
Should he lay by the personal and make
Of his own fate an instance of all fate?
What is one man among so many men?
What are so many men in such a world?
Can one man think one thing and think it long?
Can one man be one thing and be it long?
The very man despising honest quilts
Lies quilted to his poll in his despite.
For realists, what is is what should be.
And so it came, his cabin shuffled up,
His trees were planted, his duenna brought
Her prismy blonde and clapped her in his hands,
The curtains flittered and the door was closed.
Crispin, magister of a single room,
Latched up the night. So deep a sound fell down
It was as if the solitude concealed
And covered him and his congenial sleep.
So deep a sound fell down it grew to be
A long soothsaying silence down and down.
The crickets beat their tambours in the wind,
Marching a motionless march, custodians.

In the presto of the morning, Crispin trod,
Each day, still curious, but in a round
Less prickly and much more condign than that
He once thought necessary. Like Candide,
Yeoman and grub, but with a fig in sight,
And cream for the fig and silver for the cream,
A blonde to tip the silver and to taste
The rapey gouts. Good star, how that to be
Annealed them in their cabin ribaldries!
Yet the quotidian saps philosophers
And men like Crispin like them in intent,
If not in will, to track the knaves of thought.
But the quotidian composed as his,
Of breakfast ribands, fruits laid in their leaves,
The tomtit and the cassia and the rose,
Although the rose was not the noble thorn
Of crinoline spread, but of a pining sweet,
Composed of evenings like cracked shutters flung
Upon the rumpling bottomness, and nights
In which those frail custodians watched,
Indifferent to the tepid summer cold,
While he poured out upon the lips of her
That lay beside him, the quotidian
Like this, saps like the sun, true fortuner.
For all it takes it gives a humped return
Exchequering from piebald fiscs unkeyed.

And Daughters with Curls

Portentous enunciation, syllable
To blessed syllable affined, and sound
Bubbling felicity in cantilene,
Prolific and tormenting tenderness
Of music, as it comes to unison,
Forgather and bell boldly Crispin's last
Deduction. Thrum, with a proud douceur
His grand pronunciamento and devise.

The chits came for his jigging, bluet-eyed,
Hands without touch yet touching poignantly,
Leaving no room upon his cloudy knee,
Prophetic joint, for its diviner young.
The return to social nature, once begun,
Anabasis or slump, ascent or chute,
Involved him in midwifery so dense
His cabin counted as phylactery,
Then place of vexing palankeens, then haunt
Of children nibbling at the sugared void,
Infants yet eminently old, then dome
And halidom for the unbraided femes,
Green crammers of the green fruits of the world,
Bidders and biders for its ecstasies,
True daughters both of Crispin and his clay.
All this with many mulctings of the man,
Effective colonizer sharply stopped
In the door-yard by his own capacious bloom.
But that this bloom grown riper, showing nibs
Of its eventual roundness, puerile tints
Of spiced and weathery rouges, should complex
The stopper to indulgent fatalist
Was unforeseen. First Crispin smiled upon
His goldenest demoiselle, inhabitant,
She seemed, of a country of the capuchins,
So delicately blushed, so humbly eyed,
Attentive to a coronal of things
Secret and singular. Second, upon
A second similar counterpart, a maid
Most sisterly to the first, not yet awake
Excepting to the motherly footstep, but
Marvelling sometimes at the shaken sleep.
Then third, a thing still flaxen in the light,
A creeper under jaunty leaves. And fourth,
Mere blusteriness that gewgaws jollified,
All din and gobble, blasphemously pink.
A few years more and the vermeil capuchin
Gave to the cabin, lordlier than it was,
The dulcet omen fit for such a house.
The second sister dallying was shy
To fetch the one full-pinioned one himself
Out of her botches, hot embosomer.
The third one gaping at the orioles
Lettered herself demurely as became
A pearly poetess, peaked for rhapsody.
The fourth, pent now, a digit curious.
Four daughters in a world too intricate
In the beginning, four blithe instruments
Of differing struts, four voices several
In couch, four more personæ, intimate
As buffo, yet divers, four mirrors blue
That should be silver, four accustomed seeds
Hinting incredible hues, four self-same lights
That spread chromatics in hilarious dark,
Four questioners and four sure answerers.

Crispin concocted doctrine from the rout.
The world, a turnip once so readily plucked,
Sacked up and carried overseas, daubed out
Of its ancient purple, pruned to the fertile main,
And sown again by the stiffest realist,
Came reproduced in purple, family font,
The same insoluble lump. The fatalist
Stepped in and dropped the chuckling down his craw,
Without grace or grumble. Score this anecdote
Invented for its pith, not doctrinal
In form though in design, as Crispin willed,
Disguised pronunciamento, summary,
Autumn's compendium, strident in itself
But muted, mused, and perfectly revolved
In those portentous accents, syllables,
And sounds of music coming to accord
Upon his law, like their inherent sphere,
Seraphic proclamations of the pure
Delivered with a deluging onwardness.
Or if the music sticks, if the anecdote
Is false, if Crispin is a profitless
Philosopher, beginning with green brag,
Concluding fadedly, if as a man
Prone to distemper he abates in taste,
Fickle and fumbling, variable, obscure,
Glozing his life with after-shining flicks,
Illuminating, from a fancy gorged
By apparition, plain and common things,
Sequestering the fluster from the year,
Making gulped potions from obstreperous drops,
And so distorting, proving what he proves
Is nothing, what can all this matter since
The relation comes, benignly, to its end?

So may the relation of each man be clipped.

I came here, being stricken, stumbling out At last from streets; the sun, decreasing, took me For days, the time being the last of autumn, The thickets not yet stark, but quivering With tiny colors, like some brush strokes in The manner of the pointillists; small yellows Dart shaped, little reds in different pattern, Clicks and notches of color on threaded bushes, A cracked and fluent heaven, and a brown earth. I had these, and my food and sleep—enough.   This is a countryside of roofless houses,— Taverns to rain,—doorsteps of millstones, lintels Leaning and delicate, foundations sprung to lilacs. Orchards where boughs like roots strike into the sky. Here I could well devise the journey to nothing, At night getting down from the wagon by the black barns, The zenith a point of darkness, breaking to bits, Showering motionless stars over the houses. Scenes relentless—the black and white grooves of a woodcut.   But why the journey to nothing or any desire? Why the heart taken by even senseless adventure, The goal a coffer of dust?    Give my mouth to the air, Let arrogant pain lick my flesh with a tongue Rough as a cat’s; remember the smell of cold mornings, The dried beauty of women, the exquisite skin Under the chins of young girls, young men’s rough beards,— The cringing promise of this one, that one’s apology For the knife struck down to the bone, gladioli in sick rooms, Asters and dahlias, flowers like ruches, rosettes. . .   Forever enough to part grass over the stones By some brook or well, the lovely seed-shedding stalks; To hear in the single wind diverse branches Repeating their sounds to the sky—that sky like scaled mackerel, Fleeing the fields—to be defended from silence, To feel my body as arid, as safe as a twig Broken away from whatever growth could snare it Up to a spring, or hold it softly in summer Or beat it under in snow.                                                          I must get well. Walk on strong legs, leap the hurdles of sense,   Reason again, come back to my old patchwork logic, Addition, subtraction, money, clothes, clocks, Memories (freesias, smelling slightly of snow and of flesh In a room with blue curtains) ambition, despair. I must feel again who had given feeling over, Challenge laughter, take tears, play the piano, Form judgments, blame a crude world for disaster.   To escape is nothing.    Not to escape is nothing. The farmer’s wife stands with a halo of darkness Rounding her head.    Water drips in the kitchen Tapping the sink.    To-day the maples have split Limb from the trunk with the ice, a fresh wooden wound. The vines are distorted with ice, ice burdens the breaking Roofs I have told you of.

At last from streets; the sun, decreasing, took me
For days, the time being the last of autumn,
The thickets not yet stark, but quivering
With tiny colors, like some brush strokes in
The manner of the pointillists; small yellows
Dart shaped, little reds in different pattern,
Clicks and notches of color on threaded bushes,
A cracked and fluent heaven, and a brown earth.
I had these, and my food and sleep—enough.

This is a countryside of roofless houses,—
Taverns to rain,—doorsteps of millstones, lintels
Leaning and delicate, foundations sprung to lilacs.
Orchards where boughs like roots strike into the sky.

At night getting down from the wagon by the black barns,
The zenith a point of darkness, breaking to bits,
Showering motionless stars over the houses.
Scenes relentless—the black and white grooves of a woodcut.

But why the journey to nothing or any desire?
Why the heart taken by even senseless adventure,
The goal a coffer of dust?    Give my mouth to the air,
Let arrogant pain lick my flesh with a tongue
Rough as a cat’s; remember the smell of cold mornings,
The dried beauty of women, the exquisite skin
Under the chins of young girls, young men’s rough beards,—
The cringing promise of this one, that one’s apology
For the knife struck down to the bone, gladioli in sick rooms,
Asters and dahlias, flowers like ruches, rosettes. . .

Forever enough to part grass over the stones
By some brook or well, the lovely seed-shedding stalks;
To hear in the single wind diverse branches
Repeating their sounds to the sky—that sky like scaled mackerel,
Fleeing the fields—to be defended from silence,
To feel my body as arid, as safe as a twig
Broken away from whatever growth could snare it
Up to a spring, or hold it softly in summer
Or beat it under in snow.

I must get well.
Walk on strong legs, leap the hurdles of sense,
Reason again, come back to my old patchwork logic,
Addition, subtraction, money, clothes, clocks,
Memories (freesias, smelling slightly of snow and of flesh
In a room with blue curtains) ambition, despair.
I must feel again who had given feeling over,
Challenge laughter, take tears, play the piano,
Form judgments, blame a crude world for disaster.

To escape is nothing.    Not to escape is nothing.

Rounding her head.    Water drips in the kitchen

As unto lighter strains a boy might turn      From where great altars burn And Music’s grave archangels tread the night,           So I, in seasons past,           Loved not the bitter might           And merciless control Of thy bleak trumpets calling to the soul.           Their consummating blast      Held inspirations of affright,                As when a faun           Hears mournful thunders roll On breathless, wide transparencies of dawn.                Nor would I hear           With thee, superb and clear The indomitable laughter of the race;                Nor would I face Clean Truth, with her cold agates of the well,                Nor with thee trace Her footprints passing upward to the snows,           But sought a phantom rose And islands where the ghostly siren sings;                Nor would I dwell           Where star-forsaking wings On mortal thresholds hide their mystery,                     Nor watch with thee The light of Heaven cast on common things.   But now in dreams of day I see thee stand A grey, great sentry on the encompassed wall That fronts the Night forever, in thy hand                A consecrated spear To test the dragons of man's ancient fear                From secret gulfs that crawl—           A captain of that choral band Whose reverend faces, anxious of the Dark,                     Yet undismayed By rain of ruined worlds against the night,                Turned evermore to hark The music of God's silence, and were stayed By something other than the reason’s light.                And I have seen thee as                An eagle, strong to pass Where tempest-shapen clouds go to and fro                And winds and noons have birth, But whose regard is on the lands below                And wingless things of earth.                And yet not thine for long The feignéd passion of the nightingale, Nor shards of haliotis, nor the song Of cymballed fountains hidden in the dale, Nor gardens where the feet of Fragrance steal:      ’Twas thine the laying-on to feel Of tragic hands imperious and cold, That grasping, led thee from the dreams of old,                Making thee voyager Of seas within the cosmic solitude, Whose moons the long-familiar stars occlude,—                Whose living sunsets stir With visions of the timelessness we crave.                And thou didst ride a wave That gathered solemn music to its breast, And breaking, shook our strand with thought’s unrest, Till men far inland heard its mighty call Where the young mornings leap the world’s blue wall.                                                    *            *            *   Nature hath lonely voices at her heart      And some thou heardst, for at thine own           Were chords beyond all Art That thrill but to the eternal undertone.      But not necessitous to thee The dreams that were when Arcady began Or Paphos soared in iris from the sea;                          For thou couldst guess The rainbows hidden in the frustrate slime,                And sawst in crownless Man                A Titan scourged thro’ Time With pains and raptures of his loneliness.                And thou wast wanderer In that dim House that is the human heart,                Where thou didst roam apart,                Seeing what pillars were Between its deep foundations and the sun,                What halls of dream undone, What seraphs hold compassionate their wings Between the youth and bitterness of things,                     Ere all see clear The gain in loss, the triumph in the tear.   Time’s whitest loves lie radiant in thy song, Like starlight on an ocean, for thine own      Was as a deathless lily grown In Paradise—ethereal and strong.                          And to thine eyes Earth had no earth that held not haughty dust, And seeds of future harvestings in trust, And hidden azures of eventual skies.                Yet hadst thou sharper strains, Even as the Power determines us with pains, And seeing harvests, sawst as well the chaff, And seeing Beauty, sawst her shames no less,                     Loosing the sweet,      High thunder of thy Jovian laugh On souls purblind in their self-righteousness.                O vision wide and keen! Which knew, untaught, that pains to joyance are                As night unto the star That on the effacing dawn must burn unseen.                And thou didst know what meat                Was torn to give us milk, What countless worms made possible the silk                That robes the mind, what plan Drew as a bubble from old infamies                And fen-pools of the past The shy and many-colored soul of man.                Yea!

As unto lighter strains a boy might turn
From where great altars burn
And Music’s grave archangels tread the night,
So I, in seasons past,
Loved not the bitter might
And merciless control
Of thy bleak trumpets calling to the soul.
Their consummating blast
Held inspirations of affright,
As when a faun
Hears mournful thunders roll
On breathless, wide transparencies of dawn.
Nor would I hear
With thee, superb and clear
The indomitable laughter of the race;
Nor would I face
Clean Truth, with her cold agates of the well,
Nor with thee trace
Her footprints passing upward to the snows,
But sought a phantom rose
And islands where the ghostly siren sings;
Nor would I dwell
Where star-forsaking wings
On mortal thresholds hide their mystery,
Nor watch with thee
The light of Heaven cast on common things.

But now in dreams of day I see thee stand
A grey, great sentry on the encompassed wall
That fronts the Night forever, in thy hand
A consecrated spear
To test the dragons of man's ancient fear
From secret gulfs that crawl—
A captain of that choral band
Whose reverend faces, anxious of the Dark,
Yet undismayed
By rain of ruined worlds against the night,
Turned evermore to hark
The music of God's silence, and were stayed
By something other than the reason’s light.
And I have seen thee as
An eagle, strong to pass
Where tempest-shapen clouds go to and fro
And winds and noons have birth,
But whose regard is on the lands below
And wingless things of earth.
And yet not thine for long
The feignéd passion of the nightingale,
Nor shards of haliotis, nor the song
Of cymballed fountains hidden in the dale,
Nor gardens where the feet of Fragrance steal:
’Twas thine the laying-on to feel
Of tragic hands imperious and cold,
That grasping, led thee from the dreams of old,
Making thee voyager
Of seas within the cosmic solitude,
Whose moons the long-familiar stars occlude,—
Whose living sunsets stir
With visions of the timelessness we crave.
And thou didst ride a wave
That gathered solemn music to its breast,
And breaking, shook our strand with thought’s unrest,
Till men far inland heard its mighty call
Where the young mornings leap the world’s blue wall.

*            *            *

Nature hath lonely voices at her heart
And some thou heardst, for at thine own
Were chords beyond all Art
That thrill but to the eternal undertone.
But not necessitous to thee
The dreams that were when Arcady began
Or Paphos soared in iris from the sea;
For thou couldst guess
The rainbows hidden in the frustrate slime,
And sawst in crownless Man
A Titan scourged thro’ Time
With pains and raptures of his loneliness.
And thou wast wanderer
In that dim House that is the human heart,
Where thou didst roam apart,
Seeing what pillars were
Between its deep foundations and the sun,
What halls of dream undone,
What seraphs hold compassionate their wings
Between the youth and bitterness of things,
Ere all see clear
The gain in loss, the triumph in the tear.

Time’s whitest loves lie radiant in thy song,
Like starlight on an ocean, for thine own
Was as a deathless lily grown
In Paradise—ethereal and strong.
And to thine eyes
Earth had no earth that held not haughty dust,
And seeds of future harvestings in trust,
And hidden azures of eventual skies.
Yet hadst thou sharper strains,
Even as the Power determines us with pains,
And seeing harvests, sawst as well the chaff,
And seeing Beauty, sawst her shames no less,
Loosing the sweet,
High thunder of thy Jovian laugh
On souls purblind in their self-righteousness.
O vision wide and keen!
Which knew, untaught, that pains to joyance are
As night unto the star
That on the effacing dawn must burn unseen.
And thou didst know what meat
Was torn to give us milk,
What countless worms made possible the silk
That robes the mind, what plan
Drew as a bubble from old infamies
And fen-pools of the past
The shy and many-colored soul of man.
Yea! thou hast seen the lees
In that rich cup we lift against the day,
Seen the man-child at his disastrous play—
His shafts without a mark,
His fountains flowing downward to the dark,
His maiming and his bars,
Then turned to see
His vatic shadow cast athwart the stars,
And his strange challenge to infinity.

But who am I to speak,
Far down the mountain, of its altar-peak,
Or cross on feeble wings,
Adventurous, the oceans in thy mind?
We of a wider day’s bewilderings
For very light seem blind,
And fearful of the gods our hands have formed.
Some lift their eyes and seem
To see at last the lofty human scheme
Fading and topping as a sunset stormed
By wind and evening, with the stars in doubt.
And some cry, “On to Brotherhood!” And some
(Their Dream's high music dumb):
“Nay! let us hide in roses all our chains,
Tho’ all the lamps go out!
Let us accept our lords!
Time’s tensions move not save to subtler pains.”
And over all the Silence is as swords. …
Wherefore be near us in our day of choice,
Lest Hell’s red choirs rejoice;
And may our counsels be
More wise, more kindly, for the thought of thee;
And may our deeds attest
Thy covenant of fame
To men of after-years that see thy name
Held like a flower by Honor to her breast.
Thy station in our hearts long since was won—
Safe from the jealous years—
Thou of whose love, thou of whose thews and tears
We rest most certain when the day is done
And formless shadows close upon the sun!
Thou wast a star ere death’s long night shut down,
And for thy brows the crown
Was graven ere the birth-pangs, and thy bed
Is now of hallowed marble, and a fane
Among the mightier dead:
More blameless than thine own what soul hath stood?
Dost thou lie deaf until another Reign,
Or hear as music o’er thy head
The ceaseless trumpets of the war for Good?
Ah, thou! ah, thou!
Stills God thy question now?

And a merchant said, Speak to us of
Buying and Selling.
And he answered and said:
To you the earth yields her fruit, and you
shall not want if you but know how to fill
your hands.
It is in exchanging the gifts of the earth
that you shall find abundance and be satisfied.
Yet unless the exchange be in love and
kindly justice, it will but lead some to greed
and others to hunger.

When in the market place you toilers of
the sea and fields and vineyards meet the
weavers and the potters and the gatherers of

Invoke then the master spirit of the earth,
to come into your midst and sanctify the
scales and the reckoning that weighs value

And suffer not the barren-handed to take
part in your transactions, who would sell
their words for your labour.
To such men you should say,
“Come with us to the field, or go with
our brothers to the sea and cast your net;
For the land and the sea shall be bountiful
to you even as to us.”

And if there come the singers and the
dancers and the flute players,—buy of their
gifts also.
For they too are gatherers of fruit and
frankincense, and that which they bring,
though fashioned of dreams, is raiment
and food for your soul.

And before you leave the market place,
see that no one has gone his way with
empty hands.
For the master spirit of the earth shall
not sleep peacefully upon the wind till the
needs of the least of you are satisfied.

Then a lawyer said, But what of our Laws, master?     And he answered:     You delight in laying down laws,     Yet you delight more in breaking them.     Like children playing by the ocean who build sand-towers with constancy and then destroy them with laughter.     But while you build your sand-towers the ocean brings more sand to the shore,     And when you destroy them the ocean laughs with you.     Verily the ocean laughs always with the innocent.       But what of those to whom life is not an ocean, and man-made laws are not sand- towers,     But to whom life is a rock, and the law a chisel with which they would carve it in their own likeness?     What of the cripple who hates dancers?     What of the ox who loves his yoke and deems the elk and deer of the forest stray and vagrant things?     What of the old serpent who cannot shed his skin, and calls all others naked and shameless?     And of him who comes early to the wedding-feast, and when over-fed and tired goes his way saying that all feasts are violation and all feasters lawbreakers?       What shall I say of these save that they too stand in the sunlight, but with their backs to the sun?     They see only their shadows, and their shadows are their laws.     And what is the sun to them but a caster of shadows?     And what is it to acknowledge the laws but to stoop down and trace their shadows upon the earth?     But you who walk facing the sun, what images drawn on the earth can hold you?     You who travel with the wind, what weather-vane shall direct your course?     What man’s law shall bind you if you break your yoke but upon no man's prison door?     What laws shall you fear if you dance but stumble against no man’s iron chains?     And who is he that shall bring you to judgment if you tear off your garment yet leave it in no man’s path?       People of Orphalese, you can muffle the drum, and you can loosen the strings of the lyre, but who shall command the skylark not to sing?

Then a lawyer said, But what of our Laws,
master?
And he answered:
You delight in laying down laws,
Yet you delight more in breaking them.
Like children playing by the ocean who
build sand-towers with constancy and then
destroy them with laughter.
But while you build your sand-towers the
ocean brings more sand to the shore,
And when you destroy them the ocean
laughs with you.
Verily the ocean laughs always with the
innocent.

But what of those to whom life is not an
ocean, and man-made laws are not sand-
towers,
But to whom life is a rock, and the law
a chisel with which they would carve it in
their own likeness?
What of the cripple who hates dancers?
What of the ox who loves his yoke and
deems the elk and deer of the forest
stray and vagrant things?
What of the old serpent who cannot
shed his skin, and calls all others naked
and shameless?
And of him who comes early to the
wedding-feast, and when over-fed and tired
goes his way saying that all feasts are
violation and all feasters lawbreakers?

What shall I say of these save that they
too stand in the sunlight, but with their
backs to the sun?
They see only their shadows, and their
shadows are their laws.
And what is the sun to them but a caster
of shadows?
And what is it to acknowledge the laws
but to stoop down and trace their shadows
upon the earth?
But you who walk facing the sun, what
images drawn on the earth can hold you?
You who travel with the wind, what
weather-vane shall direct your course?
What man’s law shall bind you if you
break your yoke but upon no man's prison
door?
What laws shall you fear if you dance
but stumble against no man’s iron chains?
And who is he that shall bring you to
judgment if you tear off your garment yet
leave it in no man’s path?

People of Orphalese, you can muffle the
drum, and you can loosen the strings of the
lyre, but who shall command the skylark
not to sing?

Once when the snow of the year was beginning to fall, We stopped by a mountain pasture to say, ‘Whose colt?’ A little Morgan had one forefoot on the wall, The other curled at his breast. He dipped his head And snorted at us. And then he had to bolt. We heard the miniature thunder where he fled, And we saw him, or thought we saw him, dim and grey, Like a shadow against the curtain of falling flakes. ‘I think the little fellow’s afraid of the snow. He isn’t winter-broken. It isn’t play With the little fellow at all. He’s running away. I doubt if even his mother could tell him, “Sakes, It’s only weather.” He’d think she didn’t know! Where is his mother? He can’t be out alone.’ And now he comes again with a clatter of stone And mounts the wall again with whited eyes And all his tail that isn't hair up straight. He shudders his coat as if to throw off flies. ‘Whoever it is that leaves him out so late, When other creatures have gone to stall and bin, Ought to be told to come and take him in.’

THE ORE

Before Man’s labouring wisdom gave me birth
I had not even seen the light of day;
Down in the central darkness of the earth,
Crushed by the weight of continents I lay,
Ground by the weight to heat, not knowing then
The air, the light, the noise, the world of men.

THE TREES
We grew on mountains where the glaciers cry,
Infinite sombre armies of us stood
Below the snow-peaks which defy the sky;
A song like the gods moaning filled our wood;
We knew no men—our life was to stand staunch,
Singing our song, against the avalanche.

THE HEMP AND FLAX

We were a million grasses on the hill,
A million herbs which bowed as the wind blew,
Trembling in every fibre, never still;
Out of the summer earth sweet life we drew.
Little blue-flowered grasses up the glen,
Glad of the sun, what did we know of men?

THE WORKERS

We tore the iron from the mountain’s hold,
By blasting fires we smithied it to steel;
Out of the shapeless stone we learned to mould
The sweeping bow, the rectilinear keel;
We hewed the pine to plank, we split the fir,
We pulled the myriad flax to fashion her.

Out of a million lives our knowledge came,
A million subtle craftsmen forged the means;
Steam was our handmaid and our servant flame,
Water our strength, all bowed to our machines.
Out of the rock, the tree, the springing herb
We built this wandering beauty so superb.

THE SAILORS

We, who were born on earth and live by air,
Make this thing pass across the fatal floor,
The speechless sea; alone we commune there
Jesting with death, that ever open door.
Sun, moon and stars are signs by which we drive
This wind-blown iron like a thing alive.

THE SHIP

I march across great waters like a queen,
I whom so many wisdoms helped to make;
Over the uncruddled billows of seas green
I blanch the bubbled highway of my wake.
By me my wandering tenants clasp the hands,
And know the thoughts of men in other lands.

Honey-sweet song

Standing, leaning, with both long- clawed paws she rips punk wood out of a tree with a high hollow to get at her cause inside—her sharp brute parentheses tear at the living humming word. The honey the tree has helped the bees hide has drawn her near with its scent. Forcing the issue, she’s heavy, off-balance, intent. Flying defenders of the sweet they’ve produced and on which they and their larvae depend, the bees swarm her nose, her eyes, her tongue, her plan, often they trace with their hovering the lying-down eight of infinity before they sting and fall mortally self-wounded. Yet always in this valor they fail to defend—and who can succeed?— the whole history of poetry.

After the wind just stops you still hear the wind’s wild almost, its approach and retreat, and how it kept circling as-if-trying, as if about-to-be, an almost-speech, loud and full of syntax casting about for life, form, limit, fate.

My wife and I were spending a quiet night at home. She was reading a magazine on the couch and I was reading my novel in my chair. I said, “Darling, can I fix you a cup of hot chocolate?” She said, “That would be great.” So I got up and went into the kitchen and started to boil the milk. A few minutes later I handed her the cup. “Hmmm, smells great. Thank you, darling,” she said. I sat down and resumed my reading. She said, “Did you know a tiger has the same number of bones in it as a monkey?” “I don’t believe it,” I said. “And a whale has the same number as a mouse.” “Get out of here,” I said. “These are some little known facts discovered by a man named John D. Baxter,” she said. “He must be crazy,” I said. Then we were quiet for a while. I looked over and she was asleep. I went on reading my novel. Then I put my novel down and got up and started to tiptoe around the house. I went into our bedroom and over to the dresser. I opened up Mitzy’s jewelry box and let the jewels run through my fingers. There were some fantastic pieces in there, diamonds, rubies, emeralds. I thought about stealing some, but felt creepy about it. I put them back in the box and tiptoed back into the living room. I tripped on the coffee table and went crashing down. Mitzy woke with a start. “Go back to sleep,” I said. “What was that?” she said. “I tripped, that’s all,” I said. She started to get up. “Where are you going?” I said. “I want to look in my jewelry box,” she said. “Why?” I said. “I dreamed somebody was trying to steal something in there,” she said. She went into the bedroom and looked in the box, then came out. “It’s okay,” she said. “Well, I’m glad,” I said. She got back on the couch and picked up her magazine. “Did you know jellyfish have bigger brains than humans?” she said. “I don’t believe it,” I said. “Well, they do. It says right here,” she said.

1.

hear them cry
the long dead
the long gone
speak to us
from beyond the grave
guide us
that we may learn
all the ways
to hold tender this land
hard clay direct
rock upon rock
charred earth
in time
strong green growth
will rise here
trees back to life
native flowers
pushing the fragrance of hope
the promise of resurrection

2.

such then is beauty
surrendered
against all hope
you are here again
turning slowly
nature as chameleon
all life change
and changing again
awakening hearts
steady moving from
unnamed loss
into fierce deep grief
that can bear all burdens
even the long passage
into a shadowy dark
where no light enters

3.

night moves
through the thick dark
a heavy silence outside
near the front window
a black bear
stamps down plants
pushing back brush
fleeing manmade
confinement
roaming unfettered
confident
any place can become home
strutting down
a steep hill
as though freedom
is all
in the now
no past
no present

4.

earth works
thick brown mud
clinging pulling
a body down
heard wounded earth cry
bequeath to me
the hoe the hope
ancestral rights
to turn the ground over
to shovel and sift
until history
rewritten resurrected
returns to its rightful owners
a past to claim
yet another stone lifted to
throw against the enemy
making way for new endings
random seeds
spreading over the hillside
wild roses
come by fierce wind and hard rain
unleashed furies
here in this touched wood
a dirge a lamentation
for earth to live again
earth that is all at once a grave
a resting place a bed of new beginnings
avalanche of splendor

5.

small horses ride me
carry my dreams
of prairies and frontiers
where once
the first people roamed
claimed union with the earth
no right to own or possess
no sense of territory
all boundaries
placed by unseen ones
here I will give you thunder
shatter your hearts with rain
let snow soothe you
make your healing water
clear sweet
a sacred spring
where the thirsty
may drink
animals all

6.

listen little sister
angels make their hope here
in these hills
follow me
I will guide you
careful now
no trespass
I will guide you
word for word
mouth for mouth
all the holy ones
embracing us
all our kin
making home here
renegade marooned
lawless fugitives
grace these mountains
we have earth to bind us
the covenant
between us
can never be broken
vows to live and let live

Lice? My aunt once drew a comb through my hair steady; she wouldn’t let what feeds on blood eat my inner tree. Where now is the word for such intimacy? I know it still, but all I see are jungles burnt of our rarest trees. My point is: it takes a while to say, “I am a fire hazard,” or, “a household of rare birds” is another way to say tree. I wrote one draft of this poem, then she died. Will I forget her name, Hasna Henna? Let’s smell a tree; night-blooming jasmine, o-so-heavenly! A sapling succeeds by flourishing from a tree’s seed. How else to perfume these needs we breathe? A sapling of course = a small and soft tree (i.e. baby tree). I grieve the rice she fed me off a palm leaf. Only now can I fully marvel: how finely formed is a tree! Someone I loved said to stop with the oceans in my poems —  well, oceans + oceans + oceans! We drown so many trees. (Night blooming tree = baby tree = once and future tree.) Lately, all I think about are trees. Read this again to replace tree with refugee. Tarfia = joy in the margins + one who lies to protect trees.

In a new translator’s version of Genesis, there’s no Adam. No serpent. In paradise, I don’t bleed. Fig leaf-free girl,dear God, I say as we converse fluently without tongues, joined as two spice-drenched beloveds in a song of songs,could we please ask the gardener to plant a pomegranate grove by a stand of non-fruiting olive cultivars, which don’t bloom and aren’t so messy? Honey, I am the gardener, says God, whose anthropomorphic footfalls caress the afternoon cool. Wolves in our botanical garden ask nothing of any human, eyes the hue of clementines plucked green off a young tree, one of five in my orchard, per telltale ringless left finger: fig, clementine, kumquat, oroblanco, and lemon. If I reside in paradise, then I get to eat all the fruit I want, all day long. No problem, says God, who calls me a little pouch of myrrh. An eagle locks eyes with mine. A dove by the pool adores the wolves as she coos, gold-amber, one stone’s throw away. Each one carries a scent: snowy owls of shuttered skies, elk, bobcats, melanin-rich skin of a feckless human. In paradise, wolves and doves coexist. Once, a clementine sat forgotten in my purse until it acquired the spots of a leopard. A world in a lion’s eye is kohl-lined gold. Aloes and sage carve a path through a brushy stand of Joshua trees, one which God made after lightning struck the agave and scrub oak. Joshua trees are chuppah arches double-wreathed with burrs, scales, fur. Joshuas aren’t guys, so yucca moths activate their ovaries. Wolves do not question why a male is missing in paradise. Yes, yucca moths take care of it. Coyotes do not question the human. Why I’m not married, why childless, howling, and whether we’ve reached the century when God invents a gossamer mousse garnished with absinthe-laced cherries served in hand-fired ceramic espresso cups, a dessert to taste together for the first time after we invent a miniature spoon no larger than a bee hummingbird, tiniest in all creation.

Joshua trees are chuppah arches double-wreathed with burrs, scales, fur. Joshuas aren’t guys, so yucca moths activate their ovaries. Wolves do not question why a male is missing in paradise. Yes, yucca moths take care of it.

Why I’m not married, why childless, howling, and whether we’ve reached the century when God invents a gossamer mousse garnished with absinthe-laced cherries served in hand-fired ceramic espresso cups, a dessert to taste together for the first time after we invent a miniature spoon no larger than a bee hummingbird, tiniest in all creation.
In a new translator’s version of Genesis, there’s no Adam.
No serpent. In paradise, I don’t bleed. Fig leaf-free girl,
dear God, I say as we converse fluently without tongues,
joined as two spice-drenched beloveds in a song of songs,
could we please ask the gardener to plant a pomegranate grove
by a stand of non-fruiting olive cultivars, which don’t bloom
and aren’t so messy? Honey, I am the gardener, says God,
whose anthropomorphic footfalls caress the afternoon cool.
Wolves in our botanical garden ask nothing of any human,
eyes the hue of clementines plucked green off a young tree,
one of five in my orchard, per telltale ringless left finger:
fig, clementine, kumquat, oroblanco, and lemon. If I reside
in paradise, then I get to eat all the fruit I want, all day long.
No problem, says God, who calls me a little pouch of myrrh.
An eagle locks eyes with mine. A dove by the pool adores
the wolves as she coos, gold-amber, one stone’s throw away.
Each one carries a scent: snowy owls of shuttered skies, elk,
bobcats, melanin-rich skin of a feckless human. In paradise,
wolves and doves coexist. Once, a clementine sat forgotten
in my purse until it acquired the spots of a leopard. A world
in a lion’s eye is kohl-lined gold. Aloes and sage carve a path
through a brushy stand of Joshua trees, one which God made
after lightning struck the agave and scrub oak. Joshua trees
are chuppah arches double-wreathed with burrs, scales, fur.
Joshuas aren’t guys, so yucca moths activate their ovaries.
Wolves do not question why a male is missing in paradise.
Yes, yucca moths take care of it. Coyotes do not question
the human. Why I’m not married, why childless, howling,
and whether we’ve reached the century when God invents
a gossamer mousse garnished with absinthe-laced cherries

Crows
and more crows.
One crow
with a rat
hanging
from its beak,
sloppy
and beautiful.
Another crow
with its wings
plucked
empty.
I wanted
so much of today
to be peaceful
but the empty crow
untethers
something in me: a feral
yearning for love
or a love that is so full
of  power,
of  tenderness,
the words
fall to their knees
begging for mercy
like tulips
in wind.
I don’t wear the crown
for the times power
has tainted
my body,
but I can tell the difference
between giving up
and giving in.
If  you can’t, ask the crow
that watches me
through the window,
laughing as I drink
my third bottle of wine.
Ask the sound
the tree makes
when the crow has grown
disgusted
with my whining.
After years of repression,
I can come clean.
I was a boy
with a hole
other boys
stuffed themselves into.
I have wanted
nothing to do with blackness
or laughter
or my life.
But about love,
who owns the right,
really? Who owns
the crow
who loves fresh meat
or the crow who loves
the vibration
of its own throat?
Everything around me
is black for its own good,
I suppose.
The widow,
the picture of the boy
crying on the wall,
the mirror
with its taunting,
the crows
that belong
to their scripture.
Can you imagine
being so tied to blackness
that even your wings
cannot help you escape?
About my life,
every needle,
a small prayer.
Every pill, a funeral
hymn.
I wanted the end
several times
but thought,
Who owns this body, really?
God?
Dirt?
The silly insects
that will feast
on my decay?
Is it the boy
who entered first
or the boy
who wanted everything
to last?

There was this bear cam on the Internet. It was pointed at a place called Katmai National Park, Alaska. A few years ago my friend sent me a link to it. I would watch it sometimes but I never saw any bears. Maybe it was bad luck because my friend said she saw bears. All I ever saw was the enormous river rushing and the tall pines in the background doing nothing. I mean, that was OK, of course. I loved the sound of the river and wind in trees and the sheer thrill that such a sublime nothingness could be witnessed like this. But I wanted to see a bear. It seemed even more thrilling to be typing in a cubicle and suddenly out of nowhere there’s a bear on your screen that maybe 50 other people in the world catch a glimpse of. Maybe they are on a break from Facebook or filling out a spreadsheet and BOOM, a bear. So I thought while I was writing this that I would just check the bear cam online and sure enough a fat bear is in the middle of the river eating a salmon right there in the Katmai National Park. I get up from my desk and tell my colleagues “You guys, come here!” and my colleagues come in my office but by the time they run in the bear crosses the river, or pixelated screen or whatever, salmon in his jaws and the only thing there is the river and trees and they say, “Sandra, this is boring,” and walk back to their own offices.

It burns up all the grass too, and breaks the stones, so tremendous is its noxious influence.
— Pliny the Elder, “Natural History”
On a blood- or honey-colored moon at midnight & no 60-watt abuzz. With
Sirius ascendant. From a dunghill’s punk egg hatched

By toad or serpent. From cold gland & pillaged crib, from ruined sluice,
Bible comics & potshots at swallows. From the Ring of Fire, the Zipper,

The Nighthawk with her victims taloned upside down. From pistis to gnosis
To the midway where they draw a bead on cardboard sheikhs. From no harvest.

From no temperate father. From years borne down tainted water
& all we failed to mark in frequencies cranked up, from

How laughing we cast our own forfeit. O well —
It’s cinch your boots up now, it’s shoulder to the wheel, it’s soldier on

To lay coins on the fang marks & stand already spent,
Condemned for what we wrongly thought exhaustion.

Comes now the bright arrival, comes the pageant rain of ashes:
The seal torn & tablets fixed but still impossible to read.

The tide pool crumples like a woman into the smallest version of herself, bleeding onto whatever touches her.   The ocean, I mean, not a woman, filled with plastic lace, and closer to the vanishing point, something brown breaks  the surface—human,   maybe, a hand or foot or an island of trash—but no, it’s just a garden of kelp. A wild life.   This is a prayer like the sea urchin is a prayer, like the sea star is a prayer, like the otter and cucumber—   as if I know what prayer means.    I call this the difficulty of the non-believer, or, put another way, waking, every morning, without a god.    How to understand, then, what deserves rescue and what deserves to suffer.   Who.   Or should I say, what must be sheltered and what abandoned.    Who.   I might ask you to imagine a young girl, no older than ten but also no younger, on a field trip to a rescue. Can you   see her? She is lead to the gates that separate the wounded sea lions from their home and the class. How the girl wishes this measure of salvation for herself:   to claim her own barking voice, to revel in her own scent and sleek brown body, her fingers woven into the cyclone fence.

each blade the length
of a universe
stretching inward toward
a singular point
of
life-sustaining unlogic—

Dressing myself behind
the heavy polyester curtain,
I listened
as dad held the suit guy hostage
with the oft-told tale
of the night he encountered
real-life Biblical demons,
how at first he felt their presence
tightening inside his chest,
and then witnessed them crawling
up and down his walls
and how he prayed and cursed them
in the name of the lord
until they dissolved
like sugar into the dark

And he never said this, but I
knew he was convinced they
came for me next
and colored my nails
and stretched out my hair
and adorned me with flowers
and forced my inside places to whisper
woman         woman               woman
late each night at the
moment just
before sleep

And I knew he knew
who I was becoming
and I understood
what the suits were for      So

I tossed them in the back
of my trunk
where they sat
waiting for years
and the day I sold that car off
those suits were still in there

The streets of Shobra are still traced

It might have been a merging
of Mohamed Fouad

He wants to finish this one song

which he has rewound a few times now,
and Mahmoud is downstairs again
yelling, holding a peeling board game
they taped together, and my brother’s eyes glint
over to the chorus, remembering how Mahmoud
once told him how his father comes home
only once a month, and he feels bad
he is taking so long to go downstairs
but this would be the last time
he rewinds the song, Mahmoud, wallahi,
he yells, the cassette player’s volume
on high but not loud enough
to drown out the street-market prices,
the chatter of bent men
at the coffeehouse, their fingers caterpillar-like

to shroud it all in the blur

if he closes his eyes hard enough,
he hears the din of keys

So I sought its paths in haste
And looked around—I saw only horizon,
And I perceived that those who flee tomorrow
And those who return tomorrow
Are a body I tear apart on my page.

I could see: the clouds were a throat,
The water formed walls of flame.
I saw a sticky yellow thread,
A thread of the history that clings to me.
A hand mulls over my life, ties my days together
Time and again, a hand that was heir
To the race of dolls and the progeny of rags.

I entered the rites of creation
In the waters’ womb and the trees’ virginity,
I saw trees seducing me,
I saw rooms among their branches,
Beds and windows resisting me,
I saw children and read them
My sand, I read them
Suras of clouds and verses of stone,
I saw them journeying with me,
I saw pools of tears and the corpse of rain
Gleaming behind them.

Our city fled—
What am I? A spike of grain
Weeping for a lark
That died beneath the snow and cold,
Died without revealing its messages,
Died without writing anyone.
I questioned it and saw its corpse
Discarded at the end of time,
And I cried out, “Silence of the ice, I
Am the home of the exiled lark.
Its grave is my home, and I’m an exile.”

Our city fled,
And I saw my feet transform
Into a river overflowing with blood,
Into ships growing distant, expanding,
And I saw my drowned shores seducing ...
My waves were wind and pelicans.

Our city fled,
And refusal is a crushed pearl
Whose powder anchors my ships,
And refusal is a woodcutter living
On my face—it gathers me and sets me on fire—
And refusal is the distance that disperses me.
I see my blood and I see my death
Beyond my blood:
It speaks to me and pursues me.

Our city fled,
And I saw how my shroud illumines me,
I saw ... If only death would grant me time.

At one time,
if my nails had been painted
this shade of rose-foam in Kabul
they would have rammed
out the frosted shell
like the tarp off
a bud’s wet belly,
they would have gouged out
each shining beast,
viscera still shiny,
each glittering pore
still insane
with breath

The pain is meant
to shame me back to the realm
of several whitenesses,
they want to chew off
the cicatrix and lodge the
septic cadaver
into a further gorge where frisks
of neon riot in aporia,
where the humility
of the body is turned to iron

The shame is a
figure with an axe
climbing a voluting staircase,
it runs the speeding drams
with agility
from the hard pallet of the
radius to the soft roofs
of the mounds
It famishes
the exquisitely nurtured
yellow
around which
breakers of scarp
hemorrhage
tigerish
glyphs, accomplishing
the gravity of
Japanese inscriptions

A delicate cancer
bares its jaw,
tufts of blood
abound
in clay,
sculpted
fetal knots
a fetal navy,
they harden to seeds,
crab-like, platinum,
growing beneath the
watery ceiling of the palm
into amiable shoots;
an aubade on delphiniums
growing clearer each day

Over many months
the permutations will again
show their round, maddening
faces,
the Persian inlay
will abound
with devout layers
we will stroke on
the fine, sensual, nymphic
chemical
paint up to the ridges where we bleed the richest
I cannot evade the force, brushing
further and further
iridescent texture
on my torso, spirit,
tongue,
I’m a
bridge of veins
in air
I’m an orphic phantasm, hair
combed through with
stalactites
I’m a bouquet
of limbs appliquéd
on pouring rain,
what can the spectral evening muster
in lament?

And the awful figure bending over Jane’s bed with the candle, that monstrous creature—well, there are flaws in the mind of Jane, too, and the awful figure bending over her might be the tormented wife of Rochester. There’s a flaw in Jane’s mind, too, looking down on the young French child born to another tormented mother whom Rochester says has inherited sin. The young French child likes presents too much, likes to dance and sing—and so what? She is love-starved, this child who has supposedly inherited sin, who will never get the approval of Mr. Rochester. We lose track of the pretty child who likes to sing. Jane goes away for a while to prove her purity. Then, when the other wife dies, Mr. Rochester will approve. Reader, I married him, she says, after she has gone away for a while. He is blind from the fire the crazy wife set. And then, miraculously, her love asks if she is wearing a blue dress. I believe she is pregnant, then, carrying a child who will be a good child, miraculously. Charlotte Brontë knew only part of the happy ending. Perhaps he gets better and sees the blue dress. We have to believe things turn out well, while Charlotte, herself, had nine months of pleasure and died. And so the book, which ends as if resolved, asks us to believe things turn out well, the French girl gone, Rochester and Jane and the baby in the burned-out mansion, because books then ended resolutely and did not reflect how it is to have a calm life, Rochester and Jane and the baby in the burned-out mansion, illustrated by the art of the woodcut, which does not suggest such a calm life, but a knife and fire making art out of wood, in a mansion that itself has been sculpted by fire and breaking things, which is how we really live.

The leaves sleeping beneath the wind:
A vessel for the wound.
Time perishing: the glory of the wound.
The trees rising among our lashes:
A lake for the wound.

The wound lies in bridges
When the grave lengthens,
When patience stretches
Between the banks of our love and death.
The wound, a gesture, is passing.

2

I give the voice of the wound
To the tongue of strangled bells,
To stone approaching from afar,
To aridity and the arid land,
To time borne on a stretcher of ice,
I kindle the fire of the wound.

When history burns in my garments,
When blue nails sprout in my book,
When I shout during the day,
Who are you? Who’s thrusting you
Into my notebooks,
Into my virgin earth?
In my notebooks, in my virgin earth,
I glimpse two eyes of dust
And hear someone say,
“I am the wound that grows
In your narrow history.”

3

I named you cloud,
Wound, dove of departure,
I named you quill and book.
And here I am, starting a dialogue
Between myself and the drowned tongue
On the isles of exodus,
On the archipelago of the ancient fall.
And here I am, teaching the dialogue
To the wind and palms—
Wound, dove of departure.

4

Had I a harbor, had I a vessel
In the land of dreams and mirrors,
Had I the remains
Of a city, had I a city
In the land of children and weeping,

I would forge them all for the wound
Into a spear-like song
That pierces trees and stones and sky,
A song as supple as water,
Unruly and dazed, like conquest.

5

World adorned with dreams and yearning,
Rain down on our deserts,
Rain down, but shake us, palms of the wound,
And break two branches off for us
From the trees that love the silence of the wound,
From the trees with arched lashes and hands
That keep vigil over the wound.

World adorned with dreams and yearning,
World falling in my brow,
Drawn like the wound,
Come no closer—the wound is closer than you.
Don’t tempt me—the wound is more beautiful,
And the wound has passed by that enchantment
Cast by your eyes
In the last kingdoms,
Passed without leaving a sail to tempt it astray,
Without leaving it an island.

Yes, I am a body of rags lying here on the bridge waiting for a hot rain to wash me open, dissolve me off the bridge because this border is closed. I rot on the boundary line and can’t enter Juarez, pennies thrown at me when a drunk El Pasoan returns in the darkness and sees my shape that makes him hurry across. No head, decades ago they threw it in the river without my screams. My arms were the first to go when I couldn’t climb the wall. I can never leave this bridge. I live on the pure line that divides countries and grabs my hunger from sliding into Mexico with my outstretched hands. I still have my knees. I used to be sold in Juarez and smuggled into El Paso, the egg that floated down the Rio Grande to break hundreds of miles away before being thrown back. I stay on the bridge and can’t move. Do not cross to El Paso without wiping your shoes of me, one foot on US concrete, the other scraping away at my Mexican rags. When I struggle against the wire fence, I make sure I salute two flags.
Is it alive?

Yes, I am a body of rags lying
here on the bridge waiting for

a hot rain to wash me open,
dissolve me off the bridge

because this border is closed.
I rot on the boundary line

and can’t enter Juarez,
pennies thrown at me

when a drunk El Pasoan
returns in the darkness

and sees my shape that
makes him hurry across.

No head, decades ago they threw
it in the river without my screams.

My arms were the first to go
when I couldn’t climb the wall.

I can never leave this bridge.
I live on the pure line that divides

countries and grabs my hunger
from sliding into Mexico with

my outstretched hands.
I still have my knees.

I used to be sold in Juarez and
smuggled into El Paso, the egg

that floated down the Rio Grande
to break hundreds of miles away

before being thrown back.
I stay on the bridge and can’t move.

Do not cross to El Paso without wiping
your shoes of me, one foot on US

concrete, the other scraping away
at my Mexican rags.

When I struggle against the wire fence,
I make sure I salute two flags.

The blood of language moves through the word cell from monk’s cell to prison cell to biological cell. I don’t know why a Braille cell is called a cell. I don’t know how many blood cells Louis Braille lost when the awl he was  playing with as a small child slipped and injured his eye.
Red blood cells live some hundred days before they are worn out by their silent hustle—looping and looping, pounded through the heart’s chambered cathedral, rushing out to the farthest reaches of the body with the good news of oxygen, squeezing single file along capillaries, like anxious deer probing their tracks through the woods. Rushing, silent, looping the circuits of the body. Again, again, again. Load iron. Dump iron. Load dump squeeze hustle.
Red blood cells pushed through the capillaries that pushed through my  retinas. They broke loose to run a green swarm in the corral of my eye. But that is history. Today cells still push through the capillaries fenced off by my calloused fingerprint. This one that I run over the Braille cell, the pattern of bumps.

A red blood cell is measured in microns. A solitary prison cell is measured in feet. Six feet by nine feet or less. I don’t know what the unit of measure is for how living in solitary changes a person. We know that living in a confined space, without access to the long view or landscape, changes the eye. The eye, for lack of practice, loses its ability to make out what lies in the distance. I don’t have a unit of measure for what this does to the heart.

A Braille cell is measured in spaces in a grid—two across by three down—that can be filled with a raised dot or bump. Different combinations of dots represent different letters, punctuation, symbols, shorthand.

The oldest cell I find in the dictionary is the monastic cell, a place for contemplation. From the concealed place where wine was stored. As in cellar. I find Braille contemplative. I touch my index finger to a bumpy piece of paper. My hand advances slowly left to right, the touch receptors in my finger triggered by the uneven contact of paper and skin. Messages run along nerves, finger-to-brain, brain-to-finger. Cognition sizzles. Mind notices this feels different than the pathway of sound in ear to auditory processing. Listening pulls me out into the world in an infinity of directions. Touching my reading educates me on my exact location in the world, feet in shoes, weight of foot on ground, weight of bones and flesh in chair.

Grain by grain, salt’s frozen tears
Help me count history’s disasters
I can’t blame salt for telling food
You’re full of wounds

Salt misses the freedom of the ocean
Remembering waves, salt jumps into a soup
But it finds there only my reflected face
It hides by making itself too soft to chew

Sometimes, salt follows a cold sweat
Waking me from a nightmare
Dreamed blood tastes like salt
As if in human failure lay the silence of God

Having swum in the ocean
Salt considers soup a shallow pond
For salt, every meal is a jail

One day, an extra salty flavor
Makes me cough and cough
It feels like cold fish bones scraping my throat
Maybe it’s salt telling me
I’m going to prison in your body
Don’t ever forget who I am!

Man of absolute physical equilibrium
You stand so straight on your legs
Every plank or clod you plant your feet on
Becomes roots for those limbs

Among the men you accrete to yourself
You are more heavy
And more light
Force being most equitably disposed
Is easiest to lift from the ground
So at the same time
Your movements
Unassailable
Savor of the airy-fairy of the ballet
The essence of a Mademoiselle Genée
Winks in the to-and-fro of your cuff-links

Your projectile nose
Has meddled in the more serious business
Of the battle-field
With the same incautious aloofness
Of intense occupation
That it snuffles the trail of the female
And the comfortable
Passing odors of love

Your genius
So much less in your brain

Than in your body
Reinforcing the hitherto negligible

Qualities
Of life
Deals so exclusively with
The vital
That it is equally happy expressing itself
Through the activity of pushing
THINGS
In the opposite direction
To that which they are lethargically willing to go
As in the amative language
Of the eyes

Fundamentally unreliable
You leave others their initial strength
Concentrating
On stretching the theoretic elastic of your conceptions
Till the extent is adequate
To the hooking on
Of any — or all
Forms of creative idiosyncrasy
While the occasional snap
Of actual production
Stings the face of the public.

By Monica Youn
By Monica Youn
One figure is female, the other is male.
Both are contained.
One figure is mythical, the other historical.
To the extent that one can be said to have existed at all, they occupy different millennia, different continents.
But, to the extent that one can be said to have existed at all, both figures are considered Asian—one from Colchis, one from Korea.
To mention the Asianness of the figures creates a “racial marker” in the poem.
This means that the poem can no longer pass as a white poem, that different people can be expected to read the poem, that they can be expected to read the poem in different ways.
To mention the Asianness of the figures is also to mention, by implication, the Asianness of the poet.
Revealing a racial marker in a poem is like revealing a gun in a story or like revealing a nipple in a dance.
After such a revelation, the poem is about race, the story is about the gun, the dance is about the body of the dancer—it is no longer considered a dance at all and is subject to regulation.
Topics that have this gravitational quality of aboutness are known as “hot button” topics, such as race, violence, or sex.
“Hot button” is a marketing term, coined by Walter Kiechel III, in a September 1978 issue of Fortune magazine.
The term evokes laboratory animals and refers to consumer desires that need to be slaked.
The term “hot button” suggests not only the slaking of such desires but also a shock or punishment for having acted on those desires, a deterrent to further actions pursuing such desires, and by extension, a deterrent to desire itself.
Violence and sex are examples of desires and can be satisfied, punished, and deterred.
Race is not usually considered an example of desire.
Both the female and the male figures are able to articulate their desires with an unusual degree of candor and specificity.
Both are responsible for many sexual deaths.
The male figure says, “When anger grips me, I cannot contain myself. Only after I kill something—a person, perhaps an animal, even a chicken—can I calm down.... I am sad that Your Majesty does not love me and terrified when you criticize me. All this turns to anger.” “Your Majesty,” here, refers to the king, his father.
The female figure is never directly quoted, but Pseudo-Apollodorus writes that she casts a spell upon the king her husband so that when he has sex with another woman, he ejaculates wild creatures into the woman’s vagina, thereby killing her. Although the punishment is enacted on the body of the woman, this punishment is meant to deter the king from slaking his desires.
Both figures, royal themselves, are angry at the king, but neither attempts to kill the king—which would be political. Instead they displace this anger onto other unnamed deaths, which are considered sexual but not political.
Both figures have spouses known for strategy, for self-preservation in  politically tumultuous times, times of many unnamed deaths.
Both figures are counterfoils to their strategizing spouses, figures of excessive  desire, requiring containment.
Both containers are wooden.
Both containers are camouflaged with a soft, yielding substance—one with grass, one with fur.
Both containers are ingenious solutions to seemingly intractable problems.
One problem is political. One problem is sexual.
They are both the same problem.
They have the same solution.
The male figure waits in the container for death to come. He waits for eight days. His son will live. This ensures the succession, the frictionless transfer of power.
The female figure waits in the container for the generation of a life. We do not know how long she waits. Her son will die, after waiting in his own wooden container. This ensures the succession, the frictionless transfer of power.
There are many artistic representations of both containers.
The male figure’s container is blockish, unadorned, a household object of standard size and quotidian function. Tourists climb into it and pose for photos, post them online. The cramped position of their bodies generates a combination of horror and glee. This, in turn, creates discomfort, the recognition that horror and glee should not be combined, that such a combination is taboo.
The female figure’s container is customized, lushly contoured. Its contours are excessively articulated to the same degree that her desire is excessively articulated. Artists depict the container in cutaway view, revealing the female figure within, awaiting the wild creature. The abject position of the female figure—on all fours, pressing her genitalia back against the hollow cow’s genitalia—generates a combination of lust and revenge. This, in turn, creates discomfort—the recognition that lust and revenge should not be combined, that wild creatures and female figures should not be combined, that these combinations are taboo.
Hot button topics are taboo because they generate discomfort.
The male figure slakes his violent desires and is punished. The male figure also functions as a hot button, a means whereby the violent desires of tourists  are slaked, while generating discomfort in these tourists.
The female figure slakes her sexual desires and is punished. The female  figure also functions as a hot button, a means whereby the sexual desires of artists are slaked, while generating discomfort in these artists.
The tourist can climb into the rice chest. The tourist can pose for a photo in the rice chest. Then the tourist can climb out of the rice chest and walk away.
The artist can look into the hollow cow. The artist can render the contours of the hollow cow, the contours of the female figure. Then the artist can walk away.
Both containers allow the tourist and artist to touch the hot button, the taboo.
The desire and the discomfort remain contained.
Both containers allow the tourist and the artist to walk away.
The male and female figures remain contained.
Neither container—the rice chest, the hollow cow—appears to have any necessary connection to race.
To mention race where it is not necessary to mention race is taboo.
I have not mentioned the race of the tourist or the artist.
The tourist and the artist are allowed to pass for white.
The tourist and the artist are not contained.
I have already mentioned the race of the poet.
But to the extent that the poet is not contained, the poet is allowed to pass for white.
I have already mentioned the race of the male and female figures.
The male and female figures are contained.
The rice chest and the hollow cow are containers.
The rice chest and the hollow cow are not the only containers in this poem.
Colchis and Korea are containers in this poem.
Asianness is a container in this poem.
Race is a container in this poem.
Each of these containers contains desire and its satisfaction.
Each of these containers contains discomfort and deterrence.
Each of these containers contains a hot button, a taboo.
The tourist and the artist can enter each of these containers.
The tourist and the artist can touch the hot button and walk away.
Each of these containers separates the slaking of desire from the punishment of desire.
Each of these containers is an ingenious solution to a seemingly intractable problem.
They are the same problem.
They have the same solution.
Each of these containers ensures the frictionless transfer of power.
Each of these containers holds a male or female figure.
The name of the male figure can be translated as “Think of me in sadness.”
The name of the female figure can be translated as “I shine for all of you.”
One figure is female, the other is male.
Both are contained.
One figure is mythical, the other historical.
To the extent that one can be said to have existed at all, they occupy different millennia, different continents.
But, to the extent that one can be said to have existed at all, both figures are considered Asian—one from Colchis, one from Korea.
To mention the Asianness of the figures creates a “racial marker” in the poem.
This means that the poem can no longer pass as a white poem, that different people can be expected to read the poem, that they can be expected to read the poem in different ways.
To mention the Asianness of the figures is also to mention, by implication, the Asianness of the poet.
Revealing a racial marker in a poem is like revealing a gun in a story or like revealing a nipple in a dance.
After such a revelation, the poem is about race, the story is about the gun, the dance is about the body of the dancer—it is no longer considered a dance at all and is subject to regulation.
Topics that have this gravitational quality of aboutness are known as “hot button” topics, such as race, violence, or sex.
“Hot button” is a marketing term, coined by Walter Kiechel III, in a September 1978 issue of Fortune magazine.
The term evokes laboratory animals and refers to consumer desires that need to be slaked.
The term “hot button” suggests not only the slaking of such desires but also a shock or punishment for having acted on those desires, a deterrent to further actions pursuing such desires, and by extension, a deterrent to desire itself.
Violence and sex are examples of desires and can be satisfied, punished, and deterred.
Race is not usually considered an example of desire.
Both the female and the male figures are able to articulate their desires with an unusual degree of candor and specificity.
Both are responsible for many sexual deaths.
The male figure says, “When anger grips me, I cannot contain myself. Only after I kill something—a person, perhaps an animal, even a chicken—can I calm down.... I am sad that Your Majesty does not love me and terrified when you criticize me. All this turns to anger.” “Your Majesty,” here, refers to the king, his father.
The female figure is never directly quoted, but Pseudo-Apollodorus writes that she casts a spell upon the king her husband so that when he has sex with another woman, he ejaculates wild creatures into the woman’s vagina, thereby killing her. Although the punishment is enacted on the body of the woman, this punishment is meant to deter the king from slaking his desires.
Both figures, royal themselves, are angry at the king, but neither attempts to kill the king—which would be political. Instead they displace this anger onto other unnamed deaths, which are considered sexual but not political.
Both figures have spouses known for strategy, for self-preservation in  politically tumultuous times, times of many unnamed deaths.
Both figures are counterfoils to their strategizing spouses, figures of excessive  desire, requiring containment.
Both containers are wooden.
Both containers are camouflaged with a soft, yielding substance—one with grass, one with fur.
Both containers are ingenious solutions to seemingly intractable problems.
One problem is political. One problem is sexual.
They are both the same problem.
They have the same solution.
The male figure waits in the container for death to come. He waits for eight days. His son will live. This ensures the succession, the frictionless transfer of power.
The female figure waits in the container for the generation of a life. We do not know how long she waits. Her son will die, after waiting in his own wooden container. This ensures the succession, the frictionless transfer of power.
There are many artistic representations of both containers.
The male figure’s container is blockish, unadorned, a household object of standard size and quotidian function. Tourists climb into it and pose for photos, post them online. The cramped position of their bodies generates a combination of horror and glee. This, in turn, creates discomfort, the recognition that horror and glee should not be combined, that such a combination is taboo.
The female figure’s container is customized, lushly contoured. Its contours are excessively articulated to the same degree that her desire is excessively articulated. Artists depict the container in cutaway view, revealing the female figure within, awaiting the wild creature. The abject position of the female figure—on all fours, pressing her genitalia back against the hollow cow’s genitalia—generates a combination of lust and revenge. This, in turn, creates discomfort—the recognition that lust and revenge should not be combined, that wild creatures and female figures should not be combined, that these combinations are taboo.
Hot button topics are taboo because they generate discomfort.
The male figure slakes his violent desires and is punished. The male figure also functions as a hot button, a means whereby the violent desires of tourists  are slaked, while generating discomfort in these tourists.
The female figure slakes her sexual desires and is punished. The female  figure also functions as a hot button, a means whereby the sexual desires of artists are slaked, while generating discomfort in these artists.
The tourist can climb into the rice chest. The tourist can pose for a photo in the rice chest. Then the tourist can climb out of the rice chest and walk away.
The artist can look into the hollow cow. The artist can render the contours of the hollow cow, the contours of the female figure. Then the artist can walk away.
Both containers allow the tourist and artist to touch the hot button, the taboo.
The desire and the discomfort remain contained.
Both containers allow the tourist and the artist to walk away.
The male and female figures remain contained.
Neither container—the rice chest, the hollow cow—appears to have any necessary connection to race.

The fools nearly killed me trying to make me one of them: a loaded word of  bond with dress codes and penal codes, postured allegiant to the culture as with the flying of flags from knots tied on the back of  head wraps worn hoods over. I can’t gunpoint when the life of this alter ego began though the possibility can’t be dismissed it began at gunpoint in a way, with an icy pressure against the temple, the mind splitting into two tracks while a circus of peers clowned.Going back far too long now, the camera has blurred my edges in the suggestion of motion even if  I stood as still as the air does before shit really hits the fan. I truly went ass-first into fronting indifference, forbade my happy teeth from public reveal lest they pop the balloon of my perfectly round face, baby-angled, already read as kind or innocent or soft from the jump when I wanted respect on my name and women on my lap like it was said I should. And, shamefully, I did. Several sistas come to mind here and this doesn’t make me feel good; a tender touch in the moonlight goes only so far for a shadow. I had to break it down for myself that being down represented the fear of having fear.I still shake when the wind blows, scary as ever, thespian as always in all ways toward the ghost of a threat or disrespect passed through me then through me, through a thin skin then through the skin. So, to compensate— a mask, what Dunbar’s bars beat home way back when about standing in the presence of the pale folks, only that idea flipped upside down, what’d be a forced smile slicing the face open like some summertime melon instead setting scowl folds into smooth forehead, brown eyes set at the mouth’s corners, fixing it in the position of silence like rusty nails.If carrying nothing else, I learned to bring this exact look to the danger because being me to the fullest would be a liability, provide a sharper image for the hidden cameras to home in on; yes, just that fast—a certified blue, strolling up to the screen door with a heavy hand for knocking and his true hand resting so sweetly on his gun. My gun, I should say, since in this case the cop is also me, like that little angel or devil used as sitcom trope.Just imagine the person coming for you being  you every time: don’t trip, you’d say, unless into the fight.

By William Carlos Williams
By William Carlos Williams
Thus, weary of life, in view of the great consummation which awaits us — tomorrow, we rush among our friends congratulating ourselves upon the joy soon to be. Thoughtless of evil we crush out the marrow of those about us with our heavy cars as we go happily from place to place. It seems that there is not time enough in which to speak the full of our exaltation. Only a day is left, one miserable day, before the world comes into its own. Let us hurry ! Why bother for this man or that ? In the offices of the great newspapers a mad joy reigns as they prepare the final extras. Rushing about, men bump each other into the whirring presses. How funny it seems. All thought of misery has left us. Why should we care ? Children laughingly fling themselves under the wheels of the street cars, airplanes crash gaily to the earth. Someone has written a poem.          Oh life, bizarre fowl, what color are your wings ? Green, blue, red, yellow, purple, white, brown, orange, black, grey ? In the imagination, flying above the wreck of ten thousand million souls, I see you departing sadly for the land of plants and insects, already far out to sea. (Thank you, I know well what I am plagiarising) Your great wings flap as you disappear in the distance over the pre-Columbian acres of floating weed.          The new cathedral overlooking the park, looked down from its towers today, with great eyes, and saw by the decorative lake a group of people staring curiously at the corpse of a suicide : Peaceful, dead young man, the money they have put into the stones has been spent to teach men of life’s austerity. You died and teach us the same lesson. You seem a cathedral, celebrant of the spring which shivers for me among the long black trees.

And an orator said, Speak to us of Free- dom.     And he answered:     At the city gate and by your fireside I have seen you prostrate yourself and worship your own freedom,     Even as slaves humble themselves before a tyrant and praise him though he slays them.     Ay, in the grove of the temple and in the shadow of the citadel I have seen the freest among you wear their freedom as a yoke and a handcuff.     And my heart bled within me; for you can only be free when even the desire of seeking freedom becomes a harness to you, and when you cease to speak of freedom as a goal and a fulfilment.       You shall be free indeed when your days are not without a care nor your nights with- out a want and a grief,     But rather when these things girdle your life and yet you rise above them naked and unbound.       And how shall you rise beyond your days and nights unless you break the chains which you at the dawn of your under- standing have fastened around your noon hour?     In truth that which you call freedom is the strongest of these chains, though its links glitter in the sun and dazzle your eyes.       And what is it but fragments of your own self you would discard that you may become free?     If it is an unjust law you would abolish, that law was written with your own hand upon your own forehead.     You cannot erase it by burning your law  books nor by washing the foreheads of your judges, though you pour the sea upon them.     And if it is a despot you would dethrone, see first that his throne erected within you is destroyed.     For how can a tyrant rule the free and the proud, but for a tyranny in their own freedom and a shame in their own pride?     And if it is a care you would cast off, that care has been chosen by you rather than imposed upon you.     And if it is a fear you would dispel, the seat of that fear is in your heart and not in the hand of the feared.       Verily all things move within your being in constant half embrace, the desired and the dreaded, the repugnant and the cherished, the pursued and that which you would escape.     These things move within you as lights and shadows in pairs that cling.     And when the shadow fades and is no more, the light that lingers becomes a shadow to another light.     And thus your freedom when it loses its fetters becomes itself the fetter of a greater freedom.

And an orator said, Speak to us of Free-
dom.
And he answered:
At the city gate and by your fireside I
have seen you prostrate yourself and worship
your own freedom,
Even as slaves humble themselves before
a tyrant and praise him though he slays
them.
Ay, in the grove of the temple and in
the shadow of the citadel I have seen the
freest among you wear their freedom as a
yoke and a handcuff.
And my heart bled within me; for you
can only be free when even the desire of
seeking freedom becomes a harness to you,
and when you cease to speak of freedom
as a goal and a fulfilment.

You shall be free indeed when your days
are not without a care nor your nights with-
out a want and a grief,
But rather when these things girdle your
life and yet you rise above them naked and
unbound.

And how shall you rise beyond your
days and nights unless you break the chains
which you at the dawn of your under-
standing have fastened around your noon
hour?
In truth that which you call freedom is
the strongest of these chains, though its
links glitter in the sun and dazzle your eyes.

And what is it but fragments of your own
self you would discard that you may become
free?
If it is an unjust law you would abolish,
that law was written with your own hand
upon your own forehead.
You cannot erase it by burning your law
books nor by washing the foreheads of your
judges, though you pour the sea upon them.
And if it is a despot you would dethrone,
see first that his throne erected within you is
destroyed.
For how can a tyrant rule the free and
the proud, but for a tyranny in their own
freedom and a shame in their own pride?
And if it is a care you would cast off, that
care has been chosen by you rather than
imposed upon you.
And if it is a fear you would dispel, the
seat of that fear is in your heart and not in
the hand of the feared.

Verily all things move within your being
in constant half embrace, the desired and
the dreaded, the repugnant and the cherished,
the pursued and that which you would
escape.
These things move within you as lights
and shadows in pairs that cling.
And when the shadow fades and is no
more, the light that lingers becomes a
shadow to another light.
And thus your freedom when it loses its
fetters becomes itself the fetter of a greater
freedom.

The way to the toy store was blocked by a fallen tree in the road. There was a policeman directing traffic down a side street. I asked him, “What happened?” He said, “Lightning in the night.” I took the turn and drove down the street looking for a way to turn back. Other streets were blocked by fallen trees, and I couldn’t find a way back to the toy store. I kept driving and soon I was on the outskirts of town. I got on a highway and drove, soon forgetting the toy store and what I was supposed to get there. I drove on as if I was hypno- tized, not noticing the signs for turnoffs. I must have driven a couple of hours before I woke up, then I took the next exit and had no idea where I was. I drove down a straight tree-lined lane with farm houses on either side. There was a lake at the end of the lane. I pulled over and parked. I got out and started walking. There were several docks along the shore. I walked out on one and watched the ducks swimming and diving. There was something bobbing in the middle of the lake. I stared at it for a long time before I realized it was a man’s head. Then, a moment later, it was a coconut. No, it was an old tire floating right side up. I gave up and started following the ducks. They would suddenly fly up and circle the lake and come down and splash land again. It was quite entertaining. A man walked up behind me and said, “This government lake is off-limits to the public. You’ll have to leave.” I said, “I didn’t know it was a government lake. Why should it be off-limits?” He said, “I’m sorry. You’ll have to leave.” “I don’t even know where I am,” I said. “You’ll still have to leave,” he said. “What about that man out there?” I said, pointing to the tire. “He’s dead,” he said. “No, he’s not. I just saw him move his arm,” I said. He removed his pistol from his holster and fired a shot. “Now he’s dead,” he said.

looking for a way to turn back. Other streets were blocked by
fallen trees, and I couldn’t find a way back to the toy store.
I kept driving and soon I was on the outskirts of town. I
got on a highway and drove, soon forgetting the toy store and
what I was supposed to get there. I drove on as if I was hypno-
tized, not noticing the signs for turnoffs. I must have driven
a couple of hours before I woke up, then I took the next exit
and had no idea where I was. I drove down a straight tree-lined
lane with farm houses on either side. There was a lake at the
end of the lane. I pulled over and parked. I got out and
started walking. There were several docks along the shore.
I walked out on one and watched the ducks swimming and diving.
There was something bobbing in the middle of the lake. I stared
at it for a long time before I realized it was a man’s head.
Then, a moment later, it was a coconut. No, it was an old tire
floating right side up. I gave up and started following the
ducks. They would suddenly fly up and circle the lake and
come down and splash land again. It was quite entertaining.
A man walked up behind me and said, “This government lake is
off-limits to the public. You’ll have to leave.” I said,
“I didn’t know it was a government lake. Why should it be
off-limits?” He said, “I’m sorry. You’ll have to leave.”
“I don’t even know where I am,” I said. “You’ll still have
to leave,” he said. “What about that man out there?” I said,
pointing to the tire. “He’s dead,” he said. “No, he’s not.
I just saw him move his arm,” I said. He removed his pistol from
his holster and fired a shot. “Now he’s dead,” he said.

The alien learns quickly, and soon the rhyme scheme and refrain are being applied to whatever it encounters: moonlight filling a green bucket by the door, a dog’s tooth in furniture, the sound of a nail gun. You go to bed and dream of planets disappearing like balls in a perfect snooker clearance. In the morning you find the walls papered with villanelles, each one signed by what appears to be a bar code. When you scan one with your phone, the screen lights up with footage of a satellite flyby through the heliosphere, trailing the sound of whale song, children crying, sustained applause, and Blind Willie Johnson’s “Dark Was the Night, Cold Was the Ground.”

Thief! Thief! came an interplanetary cry, causing me to gaze up into the star-brilliant firmament, for it wasn’t just a sky anymore. It had taken on biblical stature. How had I gotten into this dress, these unruly waves, this queasy feeling I would be found out? Time to run! my heart said, pumping away under its brocade of diamonds.

was I doing in high heels in sand in a diamond-studded

dress that had to be stolen? Fear washed
through me, as if one of those waves had
risen up and, against all the rules of waves,
splashed me from the shoulders
down. I was wet with diamonds and fear.
A small boat held offshore with its cold
yellow light pointing a long watery finger at me

while the stolen feeling of the dress sparkled
my location out into the universe. Thief! Thief!
came an interplanetary cry, causing me to
gaze up into the star-brilliant firmament,
for it wasn’t just a sky anymore. It had
taken on biblical stature. How had I
gotten into this dress, these unruly

waves, this queasy feeling I would be
found out? Time to run! my heart said,
pumping away under its brocade
of diamonds. Strange vacancies had
accumulated after all my sleep-plundered
nights. Thief! came the cry again, as if
I should recognize myself. And I did.

I flung those high heels into the depths,
took up my newfound identity, and without
the least remorse, began to run those diamonds
right out of this world.

So I entered suffering. A room with dazzling walls, starched drapes, a bed with the coverlet turned down just so. Shirred bed skirts. The pillowcase crisp, bearing the marks of the iron. A low wrought iron table with a pitcher and its glass of water. Curtain half cinched.
Was anyone else ever here? Not a trace of a prior occupant. No candy wrapper. No smudge on the high-gloss sheen. Yet I marvel at the labor that must have gone into all those preparations: someone lifting the mattress, twice, as you must, and adding the final touches; smoothing away all traces of a final touch, filling the glass precisely, so the camber of water fits like a seal over the rim.
A radio on the nightstand. It lights up, and there’s the very voice in my mind, arguing with itself, trying to convince itself that it suffers. Why so many hypnotic cadences, so many rhetorical flourishes—anaphora, chiasmus, parataxis—such subtle case logic, Rogerian argument, appeals to so many arbiters: God, reason, justice, twilight?
Search from station to station, and the white noise in between. On fm, am, and shortwave, the same rapt monologue. That marshaling of precedent, scientific data, illustrations from the history of medicine, the Upanishads, the Vedas, the sutras and suras, the Sermon on the Mount. But what is  suffering? Is it true that it requires my consent?
In a shaft of evening, the trillion worlds collide.

Let’s see, Poetaster, how your sinuses like these! Her eyes lit up like a clutch of desert sunrises. Hessian, leather, cedarwood slats, shavings of gold leaf, Tyrian silk, muslin, bronze buckles, tamarind, juniper, quinces and kumquats in barrels. There, Poet-guy!

They lost a hound, had to let go five bolts of silk, for water; her men got fighting with silver-knived brigands with brassy tongues; her women split into those who desired celebrity with the P-g, who made her laugh, and those who wished her well, this time, which made her maudlin. A baby needled for food and a warm cot. Eventually they arrived at Poetman’s place—his birthplace, the guide clarified—a simple lodge overshadowed by leaning olives. A bench out back and buckets for livestock. Someone lives here, still? She felt rigid, rich with anticipating. They pressed in: porticoes in parallel lines, orange poppies in deep beds; acres, east and west, of orchids. Her heart went skip-a-hop; her stomach sick, to its pit.

Before the unseen cock had called the time,      Those workers left their beds and stumbled out Into the street, where dust lay white as lime      Under the last star that keeps bats about. Then blinking still from bed, they trod the street,      The doors closed up and down ;  the traveller heard Doors opened, closed, then silence, then men’s feet      Moving to toil, the men too drowsed for word. The bean-field was a greyness as they passed,      The darkness of the hedge was starred with flowers, The moth, with wings like dead leaves, sucked his last,      The triumphing cock cried out with all his powers ; His fire of crying made the twilight quick, Then clink, clink, clink, men’s trowels tapped the brick.   I saw the delicate man who built the tower      Look from the turret at the ground below, The granite column wavered like a flower,      But stood in air whatever winds might blow. Its roots were in the rock, its head stood proud,      No earthly forest reared a head so high ; Sometimes the eagle came there, sometimes cloud,      It was man’s ultimate footstep to the sky. And in that peak the builder kept his treasure,      Books with the symbols of his art, the signs Of knowledge in excitement, skill in pleasure,      The edge that cut, the rule that kept the lines. He who had seen his tower beneath the grass, Rock in the earth, now smiled, because it was.   How many thousand men had done his will,        Men who had hands, or arms, or strength to spend, Or cunning with machines, or art, or skill !      All had obeyed him, working to this end.       Hundreds in distant lands had given their share      Of power, to deck it ;  on its every stone Their oddity of pleasure was laid bare,      Yet was the tower his offspring, his alone. His inner eye had seen, his will had made it,      All the opposing army of men’s minds Had bowed, had turned, had striven as he bade it,      Each to his purpose in their myriad kinds. Now it was done, and in the peak he stood Seeing his work, and smiled to find it good.   It had been stone, earth’s body, hidden deep,      Lightless and shapeless, where it cooled and hardened. Now it was as the banner on man’s keep      Or as the Apple in Eden where God gardened. Lilies of stone ran round it, and like fires      The tongues of crockets shot from it and paused, Horsemen who raced were carven on’t, the spires      Were bright with gold ;  all this the builder caused. And standing there, it seemed that all the hive      Of human skill which now it had become, Was stone no more, nor building, but alive,      Trying to speak, this tower that was dumb,  Trying to speak, nay, speaking, soul to soul With powers who are, to raven or control

Before the unseen cock had called the time,
Those workers left their beds and stumbled out
Into the street, where dust lay white as lime
Under the last star that keeps bats about.
Then blinking still from bed, they trod the street,
The doors closed up and down ;  the traveller heard
Doors opened, closed, then silence, then men’s feet
Moving to toil, the men too drowsed for word.
The bean-field was a greyness as they passed,
The darkness of the hedge was starred with flowers,
The moth, with wings like dead leaves, sucked his last,
The triumphing cock cried out with all his powers ;
His fire of crying made the twilight quick,
Then clink, clink, clink, men’s trowels tapped the brick.

I saw the delicate man who built the tower
Look from the turret at the ground below,
The granite column wavered like a flower,
But stood in air whatever winds might blow.
Its roots were in the rock, its head stood proud,
No earthly forest reared a head so high ;
Sometimes the eagle came there, sometimes cloud,
It was man’s ultimate footstep to the sky.
And in that peak the builder kept his treasure,
Books with the symbols of his art, the signs
Of knowledge in excitement, skill in pleasure,
The edge that cut, the rule that kept the lines.
He who had seen his tower beneath the grass,
Rock in the earth, now smiled, because it was.

How many thousand men had done his will,
Men who had hands, or arms, or strength to spend,
Or cunning with machines, or art, or skill !
All had obeyed him, working to this end.
Hundreds in distant lands had given their share
Of power, to deck it ;  on its every stone
Their oddity of pleasure was laid bare,
Yet was the tower his offspring, his alone.
His inner eye had seen, his will had made it,
All the opposing army of men’s minds
Had bowed, had turned, had striven as he bade it,
Each to his purpose in their myriad kinds.
Now it was done, and in the peak he stood
Seeing his work, and smiled to find it good.

It had been stone, earth’s body, hidden deep,
Lightless and shapeless, where it cooled and hardened.
Now it was as the banner on man’s keep
Or as the Apple in Eden where God gardened.
Lilies of stone ran round it, and like fires
The tongues of crockets shot from it and paused,
Horsemen who raced were carven on’t, the spires
Were bright with gold ;  all this the builder caused.
And standing there, it seemed that all the hive
Of human skill which now it had become,
Was stone no more, nor building, but alive,
Trying to speak, this tower that was dumb,
Trying to speak, nay, speaking, soul to soul
With powers who are, to raven or control

And he answered:
Where shall you seek beauty, and how
shall you find her unless she herself be your
way and your guide?
And how shall you speak of her except
she be the weaver of your speech?

The aggrieved and the injured say,
“Beauty is kind and gentle.
Like a young mother half-shy of her
own glory she walks among us.”
And the passionate say, “Nay, beauty is
a thing of might and dread.
Like the tempest she shakes the earth
beneath us and the sky above us.”

The tired and the weary say, “Beauty is
of soft whisperings. She speaks in our spirit.
Her voice yields to our silences like a faint
light that quivers in fear of the shadow.”
But the restless say, “We have heard her
shouting among the mountains,
And with her cries came the sound of
hoofs, and the beating of wings and
the roaring of lions.”

At night the watchmen of the city say,
“Beauty shall rise with the dawn from the
east.”
And at noontide the toilers and the way-
farers say, “We have seen her leaning over
the earth from the windows of the sunset.”

In winter say the snow-bound, “She shall
come with the spring leaping upon the hills.”
And in the summer heat the reapers say,
“We have seen her dancing with the autumn
leaves, and we saw a drift of snow in her
hair.”
All these things have you said of beauty,
Yet in truth you spoke not of her but of
needs unsatisfied,
And beauty is not a need but an ecstasy.
It is not a mouth thirsting nor an empty
hand stretched forth,
But rather a heart enflamed and a soul en-
chanted.
It is not the image you would see nor the
song you would hear,
But rather an image you see though you
close your eyes and a song you hear though
you shut your ears.
It is not the sap within the furrowed bark,
nor a wing attached to a claw,
But rather a garden for ever in bloom and
a flock of angels for ever in flight.

People of Orphalese, beauty is life when
life unveils her holy face.
But you are life and you are the veil.
Beauty is eternity gazing at itself in a mir-
ror.
But you are eternity and you are the mir-
ror.

I have hidden your lost teeth in the net of all my famous hair And with foresight promised your umbilicus To several minor gods.

By Christian Wiman
By Christian Wiman
Today I woke and believed in nothing. A grief at once intimate and unfelt, like the death of a good friend’s dog. Tired of the mind reaching back in the past for rescue I praise the day. I don’t mean merely some mythical, isolate instant like the mindless mindfulness specialist who at the terminal cancer convention (not that it was called that) exhorted the new year’s crop of slaughters (ditto) to “taste” the day, this one unreplicable instant of being alive. (The chicken glistened.) Nor do I mean a day devoid of past and future as craved that great craze of minds and times Fernando Pessoa, who wanted not “the present” but reality itself, things in their thingness rather than the time that measures them. Time is in the table at which I sit and in the words I type. In the red-checked shirt my father’s mother used to wear when she was gardening and which I kept because it held her smell (though it does no longer) there is still plenty of time. Two murderers keep their minds alive while they wait to die. They talk through slots in their doors of whatever mercy or misery the magazine has ordained for the day —  the resurgence of the Taliban in Afghanistan, say, ten signs that a relationship is on the rocks. When their communion flags, as communions will, they rekindle it with personal revelations, philosophical digressions, humor. This is a true story, one of them says sometimes by way of preface, as if that gave the moment more gravity, asked of the listener a different attention, at once resisted and reinforced an order wherein every hour has its sound, every day its grace, and every death is by design. “Love is possible for anyone,” I hear the TV talk-show host say, which is true in the way most things in this life are true, which is to say, false, unless and until the nullifying, catalyzing death is felt. Love is possible for anyone because it is equally impossible for everyone. To be is to be confronted with a void, a blankness, a blackness that both appeals and appalls. Once known — known by the void, I mean — one has three choices. Walk away, and unlearn the instinct of awe. Walk along, and learn to believe that awe asks nothing of you. Are you with me, love? (For love read faith.) Naked once and after a rat, my father cried, “Die, vermin, die!” banging the broomstick over and over on the floor so incorrigibly dirty it might as well have been the earth itself. This is my mother’s story, though I was there, I’m told, and no small part of the pandemonium. We were five souls crammed into one life, and so incorrigibly poor — or was that fear? — we all slept in one room and shared one great big chester drawers, as we called it, and not with irony but in earnest ignorance, just as like meant lack, as in “How much do you like bein’ done with your chemo?” and just as I and every other child I knew, before we tucked into our lemon meringue pie, solemnly wiped the calf slobbers off. Ah, local color, peasant levity, the language fuming and steaming rich as the mist of rot that rises off the compost heap (“kitchen midden,” you might hear an old Scot still say). When do we first know? That there’s a world to which we’ve been, not oblivious, exactly, but so inside we couldn’t see it, who now see nothing else? Heaven is over. Or hell. Did you forget the rat? It thumps and thrashes like a poltergeist inside the chest of drawers but somehow, though my father is fast, and though his rage is becoming real, every drawer he opens is empty. What happens when we die, every child of every father eventually asks. What happens when we don’t is the better question. To kill a wasp on water is the peak of speed. My brother who is other has a mind of lead. I with my stinging griefs watch from away. How can it be there are no adults left? What matters here is timing, not time. His hand is high and white above the blue. A wasp is also atom and urge, hover and touch. Even wings are not a clean distinction. Down comes the slap like a rifle shot. What vengeance can there be on blank necessity? My brother who is other has a way. His hand is high and white. And then it’s not. Once when my father’s mother’s health was failing and she found it more and more difficult to tend to the tiny family plot at Champion, Texas, which is less town than time at this point, a blink of old buildings and older longings the rare driver flashes past, I took it upon myself to salt the graves as I must have read somewhere would work for unwanted growths. As indeed it did. In the months after, every Sunday when we spoke, she thanked me for the blankness, the blackness, (my words, of course) this new ease I had allowed her mind. Until one day leaning over with flowers the leached earth opened and my eighty-year-old grandmother tumbled right down among the bones of the woman from whom she’d first emerged. To see that image you have to be that sky. It has to happen in you, that crushing calling viewless blue that is so deeply in you that it is not you. “O, Law’, honey, I like to died.” You don’t climb out of poverty so much as carry it with you. Some shell themselves with wealth. Some get and spend, get and spend, skimming existence like a Jesus lizard. But for those whose souls have known true want — whose souls perhaps are true want —  money remains, in some sense, permanently inert, like an erotic thought that flashes through a eunuch’s brain. In 1980 my father bought his first airplane, a scream-proof four-seater we crammed five inside, which he considerately slammed into a sorghum field alone. Unkillable, he killed the next ten years with work and wives, then bought another, and brought it down in the solitary fire that was his aspect and atmosphere. Homes, schemes, thirty years of savings plowed into a sign company (!) that did not, it turned out, exist. A hole is hard to carry. People ask if I believe in God and the verb is tedious to me. Not wrong, not offensive, not intrusive, not embarrassing. Tedious. Today I saw a hawk land on Elizabeth’s chimney. It sat with its bone frown and banker’s breast above the proud houses of Hamden. Are you with me? Then see, too, a lump of animate ash rising from the flue (or so it seems) to be a pigeon fluttering dumbly down next to that implacable raptor, suddening a world of strange relations wherein there is no need for fear, or far, or meat. There was a man made of airplane parts, one of which was always missing. He wandered the hospital grounds in search of a rudder, an aileron, or some other fragment that would let him fly from this place where he was not meant to be. There was a woman who emitted invective ceaselessly, dispassionately, an obscenity machine. One timid gentleman saved Saran wrap for five full years and every night wrought an ever-more-solid ball with which, it turned out, he planned to bash the skull of the first soul he saw the dawn God blessed his weapon. (A success story, alas.) Another man with anvil hands sat six months of nights in faith that there would come occasion of darkness, unguardedness, and vision sufficient to rip from its socket one of my father’s bright blue eyes. (Ditto.) My father moved among them like a father. He attended and pacified, he instructed and consoled. Late to the trade, he worked too much, and trusted his heart, no doubt, more than he should, but was, by all accounts, at this one thing, and despite the end, good. For love read faith into these lines that so obviously lack it. For love let words turn to life in the way life turns to world under the observer’s eye, the swirl of particles with their waves and entanglements, their chance and havoc, resolving into some one thing: a raptor on a rooftop, say. No power on earth can make it stay. But is it lost or released into formlessness when we look away? To be is to believe that the man or woman who inscribed with an idiosyncratic but demanding calligraphyFuck da money — Trust no one on the rough blanket of the residential motel where my father spent the last two years of his rough residential life intended the note of defiant, self-conscious (da!) humor that left my father, whom I had not seen in years, and I, whom years had seen grow sere, far even from myself, erupting in laughter until we cried. Before my good friend’s good dog died ten times a day she pressed her forehead to his “to confirm the world and her place in it.” Now she won’t even say his name. Strange how the things that burn worst in one heart one must keep silent to keep. Ten to one you thought of men. The murderers, I mean. But no. This is a true story. There is another cell, you see, in which a woman I have known since childhood, and since childhood have known to be suspended on a wire of time but nimble-witted nonetheless, lies on the cold stone floor. She is even more naked than they have made her. She has killed no one not even herself. Punishment, perhaps, or some contagion of fate, finds her here, her hair shorn, both wrists wrapped, her eyes open, pondering the parable of perfect silence.Remember, he said, memory is a poor man’s prison. Make to have and to love one live infinitive, then blessed my brow with the sign of the cross. I woke without a chance to ask the obvious: But what if all our songs are songs of loss? I felt nothing when you died, Father. (As if I ever called you that.) It is a long cold seep, this grief. The day itself was hot enough to make the devil sweat, as more than one person, with less than one mind, muttered to me. What I remember: two children, too tan and “clad in famine” (Dahlberg), look up from their parched front yard, their sad little sprinkler like a flower of hell. I don’t mean I saw them, though I did. I mean they are what I remember, fleshed. That town. A hint of new prison business, and the Square’s been rewhitened, but mostly it’s beastly, a blast site, our old house less house than nest, and even the undertaker, a friend from high school, has graduated to heroin. You would have been right at home, and I guess in a ghoulish way you were, overdressed, overdosed, over. Hard wind at the graveside. Hard lives hardly there. The canopy whipped and flapped. A bouquet skipped over the graves like a strange elation. Something stuck, and an ageless Indian (he might have been Mom’s long-dead granddad) nimbled over the casket’s contraptions to make it go. You go into the ground again, and the silence assaults like heat, and the clumps of would-be grievers unclump and head for cars, and Mom cracks a tallboy and two jokes before we’re on the highway. The first I forget, and of the second I recall only a nakedness, and wild crying, and a rat. When the doctor said I’d likely die I thought of my father telling me he’d learned to read a cancer look, that some people had it before they had it, so to speak. When the young guard demanded to unwrap the Snickers I’d bought for my sister my father scoffed: “All this energy expended on candy when you could take this can” — he held her Coke up in front of our eyes — “and cut a throat.” When my sister, chewing her chocolate with ravenous indifference, paused and stared balefully off at the even more baleful brown beyond the barbed wire, it did not occur to me that it was inspiration. When I began writing these lines it was not, to be sure, inspiration but desperation, to be alive, to believe again in the love of God. The love of God is not a thing one comprehends but that by which — and only by which — one is comprehended. It is like the child’s time of pre-reflective being, and like that time, we learn it by its lack. Flashes and fragments, flashes and fragments, these images are not facets of some unknowable whole but entire existences in themselves, like worlds that under God’s gaze shear and shear and, impossibly, are: untouching, entangled, sustained, free. If all love demands imagination, all love demands withdrawal. We must create the life creating us, and must allow that life to be —  and to be beyond, perhaps, whatever we might imagine. I, too, am more (and less) than anything I imagine myself to be. “To know this,” says Simone Weil, “is forgiveness.” It is an air you enter, not an act you make. It is the will’s frustration, and is the will’s fruition. It is to wade a blaze one night that I once crossed — a young man, and lost —  to find a woman made of weather sweeping the street in front of her shack. It is another country. It is a language I don’t know.La por allá, la por allá, I repeat in my sleep. The over there. Tired of the mind reaching back in the past for rescue I praise the day my father woke in the motel room where all five of us were sleeping, which is not even past but a flame as I say it, and see it, the little lighter now he is using to find his clothes. I who have not slept in forty-five years am awake for the first time rising carefully out of my pallet on the floor and feeling my way beyond the bodies of my brother and sister toward the shade that is my father to stand in this implausible light where to whisper would be too much, and anyway what’s next is known, Dad, and near, the nowhere diner, hot chocolate and the funny pages, and the consolation that comes when there is nothing to console.
Today I woke and believed in nothing. A grief at once intimate and unfelt, like the death of a good friend’s dog. Tired of the mind reaching back in the past for rescue I praise the day. I don’t mean merely some mythical, isolate instant like the mindless mindfulness specialist who at the terminal cancer convention (not that it was called that) exhorted the new year’s crop of slaughters (ditto) to “taste” the day, this one unreplicable instant of being alive. (The chicken glistened.) Nor do I mean a day devoid of past and future as craved that great craze of minds and times Fernando Pessoa, who wanted not “the present” but reality itself, things in their thingness rather than the time that measures them. Time is in the table at which I sit and in the words I type. In the red-checked shirt my father’s mother used to wear when she was gardening and which I kept because it held her smell (though it does no longer) there is still plenty of time. Two murderers keep their minds alive while they wait to die. They talk through slots in their doors of whatever mercy or misery the magazine has ordained for the day —  the resurgence of the Taliban in Afghanistan, say, ten signs that a relationship is on the rocks. When their communion flags, as communions will, they rekindle it with personal revelations, philosophical digressions, humor.

Homes, schemes, thirty years of savings plowed into a sign company (!) that did not, it turned out, exist. A hole is hard to carry. People ask if I believe in God and the verb is tedious to me. Not wrong, not offensive, not intrusive, not embarrassing. Tedious. Today I saw a hawk land on Elizabeth’s chimney. It sat with its bone frown and banker’s breast above the proud houses of Hamden. Are you with me? Then see, too, a lump of animate ash rising from the flue (or so it seems) to be a pigeon fluttering dumbly down next to that implacable raptor, suddening a world of strange relations wherein there is no need for fear, or far, or meat. There was a man made of airplane parts, one of which was always missing. He wandered the hospital grounds in search of a rudder, an aileron, or some other fragment that would let him fly from this place where he was not meant to be. There was a woman who emitted invective ceaselessly, dispassionately, an obscenity machine. One timid gentleman saved Saran wrap for five full years and every night wrought an ever-more-solid ball with which, it turned out, he planned to bash the skull of the first soul he saw the dawn God blessed his weapon. (A success story, alas.) Another man with anvil hands sat six months of nights in faith that there would come occasion of darkness, unguardedness, and vision sufficient to rip from its socket one of my father’s bright blue eyes. (Ditto.) My father moved among them like a father. He attended and pacified, he instructed and consoled. Late to the trade, he worked too much, and trusted his heart, no doubt, more than he should, but was, by all accounts, at this one thing, and despite the end, good. For love read faith into these lines that so obviously lack it. For love let words turn to life in the way life turns to world under the observer’s eye, the swirl of particles with their waves and entanglements, their chance and havoc, resolving into some one thing: a raptor on a rooftop, say. No power on earth can make it stay. But is it lost or released into formlessness when we look away? To be is to believe that the man or woman who inscribed with an idiosyncratic but demanding calligraphyFuck da money — Trust no one on the rough blanket of the residential motel where my father spent the last two years of his rough residential life intended the note of defiant, self-conscious (da!) humor that left my father, whom I had not seen in years, and I, whom years had seen grow sere, far even from myself, erupting in laughter until we cried. Before my good friend’s good dog died ten times a day she pressed her forehead to his “to confirm the world and her place in it.” Now she won’t even say his name. Strange how the things that burn worst in one heart one must keep silent to keep. Ten to one you thought of men. The murderers, I mean. But no. This is a true story. There is another cell, you see, in which a woman I have known since childhood, and since childhood have known to be suspended on a wire of time but nimble-witted nonetheless, lies on the cold stone floor. She is even more naked than they have made her. She has killed no one not even herself. Punishment, perhaps, or some contagion of fate, finds her here, her hair shorn, both wrists wrapped, her eyes open, pondering the parable of perfect silence.Remember, he said, memory is a poor man’s prison. Make to have and to love one live infinitive, then blessed my brow with the sign of the cross. I woke without a chance to ask the obvious: But what if all our songs are songs of loss? I felt nothing when you died, Father. (As if I ever called you that.) It is a long cold seep, this grief. The day itself was hot enough to make the devil sweat, as more than one person, with less than one mind, muttered to me. What I remember: two children, too tan and “clad in famine” (Dahlberg), look up from their parched front yard, their sad little sprinkler like a flower of hell. I don’t mean I saw them, though I did. I mean they are what I remember, fleshed. That town. A hint of new prison business, and the Square’s been rewhitened, but mostly it’s beastly, a blast site, our old house less house than nest, and even the undertaker, a friend from high school, has graduated to heroin. You would have been right at home, and I guess in a ghoulish way you were, overdressed, overdosed, over. Hard wind at the graveside. Hard lives hardly there. The canopy whipped and flapped. A bouquet skipped over the graves like a strange elation. Something stuck, and an ageless Indian (he might have been Mom’s long-dead granddad) nimbled over the casket’s contraptions to make it go. You go into the ground again, and the silence assaults like heat, and the clumps of would-be grievers unclump and head for cars, and Mom cracks a tallboy and two jokes before we’re on the highway. The first I forget, and of the second I recall only a nakedness, and wild crying, and a rat. When the doctor said I’d likely die I thought of my father telling me he’d learned to read a cancer look, that some people had it before they had it, so to speak. When the young guard demanded to unwrap the Snickers I’d bought for my sister my father scoffed: “All this energy expended on candy when you could take this can” — he held her Coke up in front of our eyes — “and cut a throat.” When my sister, chewing her chocolate with ravenous indifference, paused and stared balefully off at the even more baleful brown beyond the barbed wire, it did not occur to me that it was inspiration. When I began writing these lines it was not, to be sure, inspiration but desperation, to be alive, to believe again in the love of God. The love of God is not a thing one comprehends but that by which — and only by which — one is comprehended. It is like the child’s time of pre-reflective being, and like that time, we learn it by its lack. Flashes and fragments, flashes and fragments, these images are not facets of some unknowable whole but entire existences in themselves, like worlds that under God’s gaze shear and shear and, impossibly, are: untouching, entangled, sustained, free. If all love demands imagination, all love demands withdrawal. We must create the life creating us, and must allow that life to be —  and to be beyond, perhaps, whatever we might imagine. I, too, am more (and less) than anything I imagine myself to be. “To know this,” says Simone Weil, “is forgiveness.” It is an air you enter, not an act you make. It is the will’s frustration, and is the will’s fruition. It is to wade a blaze one night that I once crossed — a young man, and lost —  to find a woman made of weather sweeping the street in front of her shack. It is another country. It is a language I don’t know.La por allá, la por allá, I repeat in my sleep. The over there. Tired of the mind reaching back in the past for rescue I praise the day my father woke in the motel room where all five of us were sleeping, which is not even past but a flame as I say it, and see it, the little lighter now he is using to find his clothes. I who have not slept in forty-five years am awake for the first time rising carefully out of my pallet on the floor and feeling my way beyond the bodies of my brother and sister toward the shade that is my father to stand in this implausible light where to whisper would be too much, and anyway what’s next is known, Dad, and near, the nowhere diner, hot chocolate and the funny pages, and the consolation that comes when there is nothing to console.
Today I woke and believed in nothing.
A grief at once intimate and unfelt,
like the death of a good friend’s dog.


Tired of the mind reaching back in the past for rescue
I praise the day.
I don’t mean merely some mythical, isolate instant
like the mindless mindfulness specialist
who at the terminal cancer convention
(not that it was called that)
exhorted the new year’s crop of slaughters
(ditto)
to “taste” the day, this one unreplicable instant of being alive.
(The chicken glistened.)
Nor do I mean a day devoid of past and future
as craved that great craze of minds and times Fernando Pessoa,
who wanted not “the present” but reality itself,
things in their thingness rather than the time that measures them.
Time is in the table at which I sit and in the words I type.
In the red-checked shirt my father’s mother used to wear
when she was gardening and which I kept
because it held her smell (though it does no longer)
there is still plenty of time.


Two murderers keep their minds alive
while they wait to die.
They talk through slots in their doors
of whatever mercy or misery
the magazine has ordained for the day —
the resurgence of the Taliban in Afghanistan, say,
ten signs that a relationship is on the rocks.
When their communion flags, as communions will,
they rekindle it with personal revelations, philosophical digressions,
humor. This is a true story,
one of them says sometimes by way of preface,
as if that gave the moment more gravity,
asked of the listener a different attention,
at once resisted and reinforced an order
wherein every hour has its sound, every day its grace,
and every death is by design.


“Love is possible for anyone,” I hear the TV talk-show host say,
which is true in the way most things in this life are true,
which is to say, false,
unless and until the nullifying, catalyzing death is felt.
Love is possible for anyone
because it is equally impossible for everyone.
To be is to be confronted with a void,
a blankness, a blackness that both appeals and appalls.
Once known — known by the void, I mean — one has three choices.
Walk away, and unlearn the instinct of awe.
Walk along, and learn to believe that awe asks nothing of you.
Are you with me, love?



(For love read faith.)



Naked once and after a rat, my father cried, “Die, vermin, die!”
banging the broomstick over and over on the floor
so incorrigibly dirty it might as well have been the earth itself.
This is my mother’s story, though I was there, I’m told,
and no small part of the pandemonium.
We were five souls crammed into one life,
and so incorrigibly poor — or was that fear? — we all slept in one room
and shared one great big chester drawers, as we called it,
and not with irony but in earnest ignorance,
just as like meant lack, as in
“How much do you like bein’ done with your chemo?”
and just as I and every other child I knew,
before we tucked into our lemon meringue pie,
solemnly wiped the calf slobbers off.
Ah, local color, peasant levity, the language fuming and steaming
rich as the mist of rot that rises off the compost heap
(“kitchen midden,” you might hear an old Scot still say).
When do we first know? That there’s a world
to which we’ve been, not oblivious, exactly,
but so inside we couldn’t see it, who now see nothing else?
Heaven is over. Or hell.
Did you forget the rat?
It thumps and thrashes like a poltergeist inside
the chest of drawers but somehow, though my father is fast,
and though his rage is becoming real, every drawer he opens
is empty. What happens when we die,
every child of every father eventually asks.
What happens when we don’t
is the better question.


To kill a wasp on water is the peak of speed.
My brother who is other has a mind of lead.
I with my stinging griefs watch from away.
How can it be there are no adults left?
What matters here is timing, not time.
His hand is high and white above the blue.
A wasp is also atom and urge, hover and touch.
Even wings are not a clean distinction.
Down comes the slap like a rifle shot.
What vengeance can there be on blank necessity?
My brother who is other has a way.
His hand is high and white. And then it’s not.



Once when my father’s mother’s health was failing
and she found it more and more difficult to tend
to the tiny family plot at Champion, Texas,
which is less town than time at this point,
a blink of old buildings and older longings the rare driver
flashes past, I took it upon myself to salt the graves
as I must have read somewhere would work for unwanted growths.
As indeed it did.
In the months after, every Sunday when we spoke,
she thanked me for the blankness, the blackness,
(my words, of course)
this new ease I had allowed her mind.
Until one day leaning over with flowers the leached earth
opened and my eighty-year-old grandmother
tumbled right down among the bones
of the woman from whom she’d first emerged.
To see that image you have to be that sky.
It has to happen in you, that crushing calling viewless blue
that is so deeply in you that it is not you.
“O, Law’, honey, I like to died.”


You don’t climb out of poverty so much as carry it with you.
Some shell themselves with wealth.
Some get and spend, get and spend, skimming existence like a Jesus lizard.
But for those whose souls have known true want
— whose souls perhaps are true want —
money remains, in some sense, permanently inert,
like an erotic thought that flashes through a eunuch’s brain.
In 1980 my father bought his first airplane,
a scream-proof four-seater we crammed five inside,
which he considerately slammed into a sorghum field alone.
Unkillable, he killed the next ten years with work and wives,
then bought another, and brought it down in the solitary fire
that was his aspect and atmosphere. Homes, schemes,
thirty years of savings plowed into a sign company (!)
that did not, it turned out, exist.
A hole is hard to carry.


People ask if I believe in God and the verb is tedious to me.
Not wrong, not offensive, not intrusive, not embarrassing.
Tedious.
Today I saw a hawk land on Elizabeth’s chimney.
It sat with its bone frown and banker’s breast
above the proud houses of Hamden.
Are you with me? Then see,
too, a lump of animate ash rising from the flue
(or so it seems) to be a pigeon
fluttering dumbly down
next to that implacable raptor,
suddening a world of strange relations
wherein there is no need for fear, or far,
or meat.


There was a man made of airplane parts,
one of which was always missing.
He wandered the hospital grounds in search of a rudder,
an aileron, or some other fragment
that would let him fly from this place
where he was not meant to be.
There was a woman who emitted invective
ceaselessly, dispassionately, an obscenity machine.
One timid gentleman saved Saran wrap for five full years
and every night wrought an ever-more-solid ball
with which, it turned out, he planned to bash the skull
of the first soul he saw the dawn God blessed his weapon.
(A success story, alas.)
Another man with anvil hands sat six months of nights in faith
that there would come occasion of darkness, unguardedness, and vision
sufficient to rip from its socket one of my father’s bright blue eyes.
(Ditto.)
My father moved among them like a father.
He attended and pacified, he instructed and consoled.
Late to the trade, he worked too much,
and trusted his heart, no doubt, more than he should,
but was, by all accounts, at this one thing, and despite the end, good.


For love read faith
into these lines that so obviously lack it.
For love let words turn to life
in the way life turns to world
under the observer’s eye, the swirl
of particles with their waves and entanglements,
their chance and havoc, resolving
into some one thing:
a raptor on a rooftop, say.
No power on earth can make it stay.
But is it lost or released into formlessness
when we look away?


To be is to believe
that the man or woman
who inscribed with an idiosyncratic but demanding calligraphy
Fuck da money — Trust no one
on the rough blanket of the residential motel
where my father spent the last two years of his rough residential life
intended the note of defiant, self-conscious (da!) humor
that left my father, whom I had not seen in years,
and I, whom years had seen grow sere, far even from myself,
erupting in laughter until we cried.


Before my good friend’s good dog died
ten times a day she pressed her forehead to his
“to confirm the world and her place in it.”
Now she won’t even say his name.
Strange how the things that burn worst in one heart
one must keep silent to keep.


Ten to one you thought of men.
The murderers, I mean.
But no. This is a true story.
There is another cell, you see,
in which a woman I have known since childhood,
and since childhood have known to be
suspended on a wire of time but nimble-witted nonetheless,
lies on the cold stone floor.
She is even more naked than they have made her.
She has killed no one not even herself.
Punishment, perhaps, or some contagion of fate, finds her here,
her hair shorn, both wrists wrapped, her eyes open,
pondering the parable of perfect silence.


Remember, he said, memory is a poor man’s prison.
Make to have and to love one live infinitive,
then blessed my brow with the sign of the cross.
I woke without a chance to ask the obvious:
But what if all our songs are songs of loss?


I felt nothing when you died, Father.
(As if I ever called you that.)
It is a long cold seep, this grief.
The day itself was hot enough to make the devil sweat,
as more than one person, with less than one mind, muttered to me.
What I remember: two children, too tan
and “clad in famine” (Dahlberg), look up
from their parched front yard,
their sad little sprinkler like a flower of hell.
I don’t mean I saw them, though I did.
I mean they are what I remember, fleshed.
That town. A hint of new prison business,
and the Square’s been rewhitened,
but mostly it’s beastly, a blast site,
our old house less house than nest,
and even the undertaker, a friend
from high school, has graduated to heroin.
You would have been right at home,
and I guess in a ghoulish way you were,
overdressed, overdosed, over.
Hard wind at the graveside. Hard lives hardly there.
The canopy whipped and flapped.
A bouquet skipped over the graves like a strange elation.
Something stuck, and an ageless Indian
(he might have been Mom’s long-dead granddad)
nimbled over the casket’s contraptions to make it go. You go
into the ground again, and the silence assaults
like heat, and the clumps of would-be grievers unclump
and head for cars, and Mom cracks
a tallboy and two jokes before we’re on the highway.
The first I forget, and of the second I recall only a nakedness, and wild crying,
and a rat.


When the doctor said I’d likely die I thought of my father
telling me he’d learned to read a cancer look,
that some people had it before they had it, so to speak.
When the young guard demanded to unwrap the Snickers
I’d bought for my sister my father scoffed:
“All this energy expended on candy when you could take this can”
— he held her Coke up in front of our eyes — “and cut a throat.”
When my sister, chewing her chocolate with ravenous indifference,
paused and stared balefully off at the even more baleful brown
beyond the barbed wire, it did not occur to me
that it was inspiration. When I began writing these lines
it was not, to be sure, inspiration but desperation,
to be alive, to believe again in the love of God.
The love of God is not a thing one comprehends
but that by which — and only by which — one is comprehended.
It is like the child’s time of pre-reflective being,
and like that time, we learn it by its lack.
Flashes and fragments, flashes and fragments,
these images are not facets of some unknowable whole
but entire existences in themselves, like worlds
that under God’s gaze shear and shear and, impossibly, are:
untouching, entangled, sustained, free.
If all love demands imagination, all love demands withdrawal.
We must create the life creating us, and must allow that life to be —
and to be beyond, perhaps, whatever we might imagine.
I, too, am more (and less)
than anything I imagine myself to be.
“To know this,” says Simone Weil, “is forgiveness.”


It is an air you enter, not an act you make.
It is the will’s frustration, and is the will’s fruition.
It is to wade a blaze one night that I once crossed
— a young man, and lost —
to find a woman made of weather
sweeping the street in front of her shack.
It is another country.
It is a language I don’t know.
La por allá, la por allá, I repeat in my sleep.
The over there.


Tired of the mind reaching back in the past for rescue
I praise the day
my father woke in the motel room where all five of us were sleeping,
which is not even past but a flame as I say it,
and see it, the little lighter now he is using to find his clothes.
I who have not slept in forty-five years am awake for the first time
rising carefully out of my pallet on the floor
and feeling my way beyond the bodies of my brother and sister
toward the shade that is my father
to stand in this implausible light where to whisper would be too much,
and anyway what’s next is known, Dad, and near,
the nowhere diner, hot chocolate and the funny pages,
and the consolation that comes when there is nothing to console.

By Paige Lewis
By Paige Lewis
Yael picks at their cuticles. When they speak to themself, they speak out loud. They speak to themself this morning. I think, they say, that I am coming down with wisteria. Their nail beds a bit purplish.
There’s a Caesar cipher decoder ring in their shredded wheat and, unsure of what to decode first, Yael hides it under their pillow. Yael says, Today I’ll be lonely. They need the practice.
Yael never drinks their cereal milk, pours it back into the jug. But they are thirsty. Outside of their tent, the lawn is still entirely a lawn — the neighbors kept to themselves last night, trampled none of the daffodils. A good omen. Today Yael can leave their tent without fear. Of what? The omen has no answer, it presents only the bright of things.
Yael shoves three empty bottles into their bag and heads toward the river.
 

•


The pigs are having a swim and pay Yael no mind as they submerge each bottle. Yael imagines the bubbles that shimmy out are the  bottle’s breath, that they have the power to take breath from anyone.
The hair on their arms turns golden. Then the water. Then the pigs flee. Yael looks down as Sun approaches. They were already kneeling.  Their shins disrupting the path of an ant colony’s leaf-carrying  ceremony. The ants do not bite Yael — Sun is watching, and the ants like being alive, love to feel the weight of a veiny leaf, love even more the sound their mandibles make piercing through that leaf.
Sun kicks a flowering fennel as He walks toward Yael, but forgets to change the wind’s direction. The seeds blow into Yael’s hair and up their nose. Though Yael did not see Him do it, Sun gives himself away by whining, It’s not my fault.
 

•


Sun’s whine reminds Yael of their husband, Heber. Heber whines like that when Yael wants to leave his tent. When Yael doesn’t invite him into their tent. When Yael doesn’t want to watch a movie that Heber has seen a dozen times.
It’s exhausting to be shown things, to try to enjoy a movie while also giving a convincing performance of that enjoyment. Heber ruins these screenings — he weeps before the scenes that call for weeping. He mouths each pivotal line.
So far, Yael has spent their life absorbing men’s favorites. On the rare occasion that Heber does ask to watch their favorite movie, Yael can’t remember having one. This makes Yael feel a creaking, hollow-boned kind of gloom.
This gloom opens the flaps in their brain that make them want to lie in bed all day.
Yael does not know the sound of their loudest yell. All their noises  have been practiced. Maybe this is why Sun’s whine makes their cheeks flush. The sound is a selfish one. Why should it go unpunished?
 

•


Sometimes, when they think of Heber away at war, Yael grows giddy,  presses their smile hard into their pillow until the whirling joy  subsides. But what is the mainspring of that giddiness? They try to dissect the thought:

          Heber = Giddy
                    Or
                              Heber away = Giddy
                                        Or
                                                  Heber away at war = Giddy
 
•


If Yael were to look up from the dirt, they’d see the kestrels circling above, their left talons leashed to Sun’s wrist by neon green fishing line. Taut line. No give.
Yael won’t look up.
Sun exhales and lets loose His belly. It peeks out from under His shirt. You can keep thinking of me as Sun. He’s relieved Yael is alone. I’ve been looking for a new name. His old name felt stale. Dead by comparison. Sun is perfect.I have a very important job for you, Yael, descendant of — He’d left His notes at home — Yael. Enlist in my war against the wicked and blessed shall you be above all people in the tent.
Sun doesn’t mention that Yael isn’t His first, or even His second, choice.

Except most things weren’t clouds      everything there

Was clouds      the hastily assembled angel

Before he knew the word      clouds was the last word

He heard the other angels shouting as

They shoved him      though he after he had fallen

Too far to hear them he      saw their mouths mak-

ing shapes that were not clouds      and when he saw that

Thought That’s      something that isn’t clouds that      shouting

After I’ve fallen too far to hear them don’t

They know      I’ve fallen too far to hear them now

Or are we not together now before

He knew the word      in those few minutes the oth-

er angels were assembling him      he named

The things he saw with words that seemed to fit them

Nothing was heavenly a few things were

Ocean and hole and monkeyapple he

Before the other angels shoved him      had

Started combining words      but nobody

Would name the things he saw the way he named them

And to the other angels all his naming

Was noise they shouted      as they shoved him It’s

All clouds      what difference could it make      to the angel

Built to monitor the Earth      from the surface

Of  the Earth      what was or wasn’t true in Heaven

They shoved him then      they stared and then they shouted

After the disappearing figure all

The things they suddenly remembered      they had

Forgotten to tell him      as they were hammer-

ing him together as they hammered him

Together and behind them      but above

Behind      a pinkish light that was or was-

n’t God pulsed      like the heart of  one of  the creatures

God hadn’t yet created though the angels

Had seen the creatures coming in the waves

Then covering the Earth      the angels had

Seen them      and didn’t want to be assigned

To live with them      and so had voted to

Build their own angel but they didn’t ask

Permission first instead they built him quick-

ly      and as Gabriel asked God      if  this

New angel could be sent instead to Earth

Fresh      eyes for a fresh world the other angels

Shoved him the hastily assembled angel

From the cloud and Heaven      he      the hastily

Assembled angel could see      farther than

The other angels though he couldn’t under-

stand what he saw as well      as the other angels

Might have      and as he fell he saw their mouths mak-

ing shapes he saw the light behind them      pulsing

And as he fell he watched the clouds becoming

Abstract      as any other angel would

From Heaven watch a species go extinct

Even as dry land emerged from the waves below him

Where are the days of Tobias,
when one of you, veiling his radiance, stood at the front door,
slightly disguised for the journey, no longer appalling.
— Rainer Maria Rilke, tr. by Stephen Mitchell


The fresco cracks cooperatively over time. Not to give a secret away but gradually to break off keeping it. In the sky you make birds like this, one wing longer than the other, an asymmetrical v wedged against wind, one stroke longer than another, never the bodies turned the same direction, each finding its own angle, and one, in the distance, a dot.

In smoke and mostly mirror. As, wedged between forward and backward being, rehashing and planning ahead, presence will be specked again with being erased, a reusable writing surface calling down to the life without rest, the self-propelled surveillances of sharks.
Where are the days of Tobias,
when one of you, veiling his radiance, stood at the front door,
slightly disguised for the journey, no longer appalling.

It was Adolphe Sax, remember,
not Saxo Grammaticus, who gets the ovation.
And by the time he had brought all the components
together–the serpentine shape, the single reed,
the fit of the fingers,
the upward tilt of the golden bell–
it was already 1842, and one gets the feeling
that it was also very late at night.

There is something nocturnal about the sound,
something literally horny,
as some may have noticed on that historic date
when the first odd notes wobbled out of his studio
into the small, darkened town,

summoning the insomniacs (who were up
waiting for the invention of jazz) to their windows,
but leaving the sleepers undisturbed,
evening deepening and warming the waters of their dreams.

For this is not the valved instrument of waking,
more the smoky voice of longing and loss,
the porpoise cry of the subconscious.
No one would ever think of blowing reveille
on a tenor without irony.
The men would only lie in their metal bunks,
fingers twined behind their heads,
afloat on pools of memory and desire.

And when the time has come to rouse the dead,
you will not see Gabriel clipping an alto
around his numinous neck.

An angel playing the world’s last song
on a glistening saxophone might be enough
to lift them back into the light of earth,
but really no further.

Once resurrected, they would only lie down
in the long cemetery grass
or lean alone against a lugubrious yew
and let the music do the ascending–
curling snakes charmed from their baskets–
while they wait for the shrill trumpet solo,
that will blow them all to kingdom come.

Where am I from?

In black basilicas
dragged incessantly
down a cross
is a man
who here resembles
a dress
snatched from a hanger,
there: thick clouds of muscles —
an overcast body —
embodied weather
of one hardly-known country.

(A country where I am from?)

Dragging him,
they stick their hands under his armpits.
How cozy their hands are
in such a warm place!

Through a cut in his chest
Eve watches
with her one bloody eye.

Of a cut in the chest — a red eyelash!

But
where am I from?


2

Yes, a man
resembles
a dress
snatched from a hanger.

Inside black
alphabet
dragged incessantly down
each letter
is a man.


3

To a telephone in a long hallway
as if to a well for water.
(Well, where am I from?)

(Neither mama’s
nor papa’s,
my round face
takes after
a rotary phone.)

A rotary phone is my gene pool.
My body rings as it runs
to put my head
on the strong shoulder of the receiver.

Blood is talking! Blood connection is weak.
Inside the receiver I hear crackle
as if fire were calling.
Who is this?

It’s me, fire receiver.

But where am I from?


4

Days of merciless snow behind the kitchen window —
snow got deposited like fat under our skin.

How large we’ve grown on those days!
So much time spent at the kitchen table
trying to decide where to put commas
in sentences about made-up lives,

yet no one bothered to tell us
that words, uttered once,
crowd in the brain like in a hospital lobby.

That time is supposed to heal
only because once
it was seen with a scalpel in its hands.

You’ve made a mistake, you’d say mysteriously,
pointing at lines written by a child. Think

of another word with the same root.
As if words can have roots.

As if words didn’t come from darkness,
cat-in-the-bag words,
as if our human roots were already

known to us.

Here’s Grammar, here’s Orthography,
here’s a paper rag “bread, milk, butter.”
What roots? What morphology? What rules

of subjugation? How is it even possible

to make a mistake? Here’s Physics, Chemistry,
Geometry with its atlas, now,

where are Vaclav’s letters,

1946?

What to do about the etymology of us?
Our etymology?

1946 crowds my hospital lobby.

The face of a rotary phone,
the face of a clock,
the face of a radio on the wall —
these are my
round-faced
progenitors.
But Vaclav’s face —

where?

(Again a man
resembles
a dress snatched from a hanger.)

And where are the letters? One
per week, in his best Sunday
handwriting?

Inside the receiver — fire.
(How cozy are my ears in such a warm place!)
But where am I from?


5

A postwar city, barracks —
the joy of a first apartment —
a coat, a jacket, a leather purse
fat with pills, but where are
the where-letters
from the where-face?

Evacuated face,
de-evacuated face,
sick not sick, stuck through face,
vacuum face,
lab rat face.

This country was tested on Vaclav’s face.
Now we can live in peace.

So,
where am I from?

A postwar city, barracks —
the joy
of a deactivated face,
vacated face.

A face snatched from a hanger.
Absence as an inner organ.


6

In a village known for a large puddle
where all children fall between the two categories

of those who hurt the living things
and those who hurt the nonliving things,

in a village known
for being unknown
(where am I from?),
a graveyard around an old church,
the frightening alphabet
around the village,
an alphabet on gravestones,
marble letters under the moth-eaten snow.

Under the moth-eaten snow
my motherland has good bones.


7

My motherland rattles its bone-keys.
A bone is a key to my motherland.


8

My motherland rattles its bone-keys.
Eve watches with her one red eyelash.

Under the moth-eaten snow
my motherland has good bones.

In my motherland people kneel before wells.
In my motherland people pray to the crosses of flying birds.

A bone is a key to my people.

Among my people, only the dead
have human faces.

Still,
where am I from?


9

Women saints in berets of golden threads,
who are they by your feet, seated like pets?

An angel with wings of a peacock,
an angel with a human face.
But
who are they by your feet,
seated like pets?

Now, if you wear such golden berets,
if you tame children and angels,
if your white boneless fingers leaf through a book
while I gnaw
on this wooden verse,

would you, holy women who wear golden berets,
put the hairs on my tongue

into a pigtail?


10

A mouse-tail of a word for a word-loving rodent!

Inside my alphabet
dragged incessantly down
each frightening letter
is a man.

My frightening alphabet in his best Sunday
handwriting.

A letter addressed to lost letters,
phone-face, clock-face, radio-face —
face as an inner organ.

Where are Vaclav’s letters
as an inner organ.

On the borderlines of my motherland
— wet laundry claps in the wind like gunfire.

Have you heard of my motherland?

My motherland is a raw yolk inside a Fabergé egg.
This yolk is what gives gold its color.

This face is a fire-receiver.
This face is an inner organ.
A bone as a key to my people.

Where am I from?

The golden bones of my motherland are ringing!

I’ve been thinking about the anatomy of the egg, about the two interior membranes, the yolk held in place by the chalazae, gases moving through the semipermeable shell. A curious phrase, the anatomy of the egg, as if an egg were a body, which it is, as if the egg could be broken then mended, which, depending on your faith, broken yes, but mended? Well. Best to start again, with a new body, voided from a warmer one, brooded and turned. Better to begin as if some small-handed animal hadn’t knocked you against a rock, licked clean the rich yolk and left the albumen to dry in the sun — as if a hinged jaw hadn’t swallowed you whole. What I wanted: a practice that reassured that what was cracked could be mended or, at least, suspended so that it could not spread. But now I wonder: better to be the egg or scaled mandible? The small hand or the flies, bottle black and green, spilling their bile onto whatever’s left, sweeping the interior, drinking it clean? I think, something might have grown there, though I know it was always meant to be eaten, it was always meant to spoil.

Best to start again, with a new body, voided from a warmer one, brooded and turned. Better to begin as if some small-handed animal hadn’t knocked you against a rock, licked clean the rich yolk and left the albumen to dry in the sun — as if a hinged jaw hadn’t swallowed you whole. What I wanted: a practice that reassured that what was cracked could be mended or, at least, suspended so that it could not spread. But now I wonder: better to be the egg or scaled mandible? The small hand or the flies, bottle black and green, spilling their bile onto whatever’s left, sweeping the interior, drinking it clean? I think, something might have grown there, though I know it was always meant to be eaten, it was always meant to spoil.

By Matthew Sweeney
By Matthew Sweeney
1 No one knows where I’m going, not even me. Although that owl I heard outside last night might lead me to the terrain and call out the custodians so they can surround and welcome me, or do whatever they want to do. I won’t speak, won’t say my name even if they try to coerce me, or play unearthly music, such as sailors hear far out on the Atlantic, in fog so thick they venture to climb it to reach clear sky. Some do and speak of large blue birds that glide there silently as ghosts, but those men return too damaged to speak much or stay above ground very long. The owl could tell more, if he wanted, but he won’t. And not only that, he’s decided he will never be seen.2 I’m happy to honor that, but I’d like to know what kind of owl he is. I mean, is he blue, or is he striped so he can blend with the forest? Is he tall and white, from the Arctic, or a pygmy, from further south? Is he long-eared or spectacled? I want to hear again the noise he made, was it a screech, or a staccato huhuhu followed by a deep-drawn whoo, or did it sound like wood being sawn? I am ashamed I paid it no attention. I did not know then he was a messenger, albeit a taciturn one. How does he know me, and why is he so interested? Once a parrot took stock of me, learnt to speak my name in exactly the tones I said it in, mimicked it endlessly and so loudly that I ran from my laughing friend’s house with my shrill-voiced name hurling after me.3 Where does the owl go during the day? How can he know I’ll still be here when he surfaces? I do take trains —  I go north sometimes, pulled by my past. I fly to places. Will he know all this and follow me everywhere? When can I expect his sounds to morph into spoken words that I understand and act on, if I agree with him? But if I decide to stay put, never leave the bedroom, will he get fed up standing there and row away through the night air, hooting a farewell? I don’t think so, no, this fellow is here for the duration of my stay on this enormous ball and could tell right now how long that will be, and what messy adventures are still ahead of me, but his trick is to keep as schtum on such stuff as the wooden owl on my bedside table.4 I’ve heard stories about owls, how they appear from nowhere at the edge of things to sit watching, usually staying silent, but sometimes uttering a few words in their night language we don’t understand. That’s my fellow, although I don’t know him. Should I leave the house and hold my right arm out for him to land on and turn his big eyes on me? As if he’d be so compliant. Or should I try to forget him, pretend he’s not there in the dark, like a tree I hadn’t noticed growing? Oh, at least I should stop mentioning him here, but what else can I write about? Not the journey I’m taking that I know nothing of, not yet, and when I do I mightn’t feel like writing. I think the solution might be to buy a T-shirt with an owl printed on it, a blue owl, on a yellow shirt, and write about that small fellow to begin with.5 What I want to learn is this: do owls ever venture inside, to stand on a corner- table, cock their heads to one side, and take in completely what’s going on? There are mice here that may be welcome, but I know my owl would be suspicious. He’d assume I want him inside to see what he looks like, to make friends with him, so he’ll be kind to me. I could promise to wear a blindfold and say nothing, act like I don’t know he’s there, but I will know and that’s enough. I think I hear his thoughts and I’m sure he hears mine. I feel his big eyes on me all the time. Maybe I should start carrying the wooden owl around with me, and practice owl noises. When is he going to tell me what he has to? I’m not asking for a map, but I’d like to know where I’m headed, if not where I’ll end up. And I’d like to know it as soon as I can.6 When I say I hear his thoughts, I hear some, not the important ones. And here’s one of mine — if he ventured inside this house he’d see something that might intrigue him, a hand-knitted toilet roll cover, in rings of purple, red, and white. Like an unknown planet hanging in the sky. I’d let him have it, take it back to his nest, or his hollow tree trunk, or his half-sunken boat. I know he’ll assume this is another example of special pleading, and I accept that. Would I do better to ignore him, let him stay out there, like a pinecone that remains unobserved? I saw my doctor yesterday, he spoke of the deterioration, and I felt the owl was hiding in a cupboard, agreeing with every word. After that I went to my sister’s grave and the owl flew back to wherever he’s been ordered to lurk while observing me. Maybe I should feel privileged to have his full-time attention.7 This morning I captured a beetle climbing the parsley. I put him in an empty matchbox, wondering what the owl thought of this. Would it impact what might be unfolding? I doubted this. I slipped on some spidery jazz that I knew would annoy the owl. He needed to be in control. I ground coffee beans and made espresso. The aroma wafted through the house. I freed the beetle to explore the table, and when it wandered off the edge I let it. I’m sure it survived, but I’m not bothered, just as I know the owl doesn’t care about me. We are thrown together, all of us, by winds that come here from far-off worlds. I sipped my coffee, humming the tune spun through the jazz, and I felt quite well for the first time in weeks, even months. Was the owl watching —  had he been in contact with the beetle? And what was their collective verdict on me? Did it add up to more negative evidence?8 OK, I’m blanking him. I watched a crow today, really admired how he operated, looking after the young ones, his partner, none of this spying on others. I’ve decided I don’t like owls, their self-absorption, or their nosiness about people. I know which I’d rather be. And I don’t have to deal with a crow stalking me. The owl would laugh about these thoughts. He’s been given the task of waiting to release, when he can, exactly what I need to know or what he can reveal. I admit he’s not easy but, shit, he’s the dumb card I’ve been dealt and I have to pretend I like him. Can I ask him about the Oxford and Cambridge rowers, or about the hairdressers the Louisianians use, or the tiger cubs that Texans keep as pets? The owl would make minced meat of them all. I wish he would hoot another noise to me. I might even acknowledge his importance, given my situation, but I won’t reveal anything.9 I felt the presence of the owl last night. He was in the room with me. Not literally —  he appeared in a dream, where a blue van struggled up an icy road before sliding back in a horrible, wriggling way, to what felt like an end. I’m not sure how it seemed so. And I can’t say where the owl was in this little film, except he was definitely there. This morning I came down the stairs, expecting some sign from him. I found a few brown feathers on a white plate on the kitchen table. OK, then, he must be a brown owl, but why donate some feathers, and what did these denote? I made coffee, then put on a CD of Anouar Brahem’s oud that seemed to suit the moment. And I decided it was the time to poach two eggs to serve on top of two slices of rye bread while I primed the espresso machine again and asked myself what the owl was saying.10 Those feathers were gone from the plate when I went back for them this evening, so I wondered if maybe I’d imagined them, or if they’d fluttered up from the eggs before I’d poached them. That doubt was caused by the owl, I was sure — I’d made him careless, and he was recovering his poise, his control. And I was back in the place where I knew nothing, where he liked me to be. I opened the door and stood there, listening, but no owl sound came. Then a bat just barely avoided my head, and glided toward the moon. I stood watching this leathery fellow, then closed the door, and opened some wine. How much did the owl control? Would I be attacked by a rat tonight while I slept, not savagely, but enough to terrify me? Or would cockroaches swarm on my duvet, clicking enough to wake me? The idea being that these would render me so punch-drunk I’d welcome whatever the owl had to say.11 I spent the morning drawing owl after owl on bits of paper, and after I’d got somewhere near a proper depiction, I found a black marker and reproduced it on an A2 drawing page which I Pritt Sticked onto the gable wall, then I dug out my old black bow and four arrows and unleashed these into the body of the owl. I knew I was being provocative, maybe even launching an act of war, but I could take no more, and couldn’t see what I had to lose. The owl clearly was unmoved by this, so I repeated the desecration four times over till the drawn owl looked machine-gunned, whereupon I flung the bow down on the grass and went in to pour a large glass of  Talisker for the first time in months, if not years. It still tasted good. I slipped on Kind of Blue, which always chilled me, and lay on the sofa with my shoes kicked off, and the curtains wide open. I thought, let the owl do his worst.12 When the dark came, I lurked in the kitchen, bow in hand, arrows in the quiver that hung from my left shoulder, like the Robin Hood I wanted to play in the school pantomime —  I got Little John instead! I kept looking out at the dark garden, wondering if I should be there, waiting to fire arrows at any sound or movement. Why did I want to kill the owl? He hadn’t given me the news I dreaded, but he’d stayed silent. That was more than I could bear. I poured a glass of Malbec and put on a CD of Baltic jazz. Did he think I could wait forever, as if I were a rock? I sliced some cheddar and a heel of bread, opened the back door and went out. The moon turned its big eye onto me, and I saw it wobble. The stars hummed along. Where am I going? I shouted at all of them. There was no response. Then far off, I heard a faint huhuhu followed by a whoo. You cowardly bastard! I roared, and sprayed the arrows all over the blackened world.
1 No one knows where I’m going, not even me. Although that owl I heard outside last night might lead me to the terrain and call out the custodians so they can surround and welcome me, or do whatever they want to do. I won’t speak, won’t say my name even if they try to coerce me, or play unearthly music, such as sailors hear far out on the Atlantic, in fog so thick they venture to climb it to reach clear sky.

1

No one knows where I’m going,
not even me. Although that owl
I heard outside last night might
lead me to the terrain and call out
the custodians so they can
surround and welcome me, or
do whatever they want to do. I won’t
speak, won’t say my name even if
they try to coerce me, or play
unearthly music, such as sailors
hear far out on the Atlantic, in fog
so thick they venture to climb it
to reach clear sky. Some do and speak
of large blue birds that glide there
silently as ghosts, but those men
return too damaged to speak much
or stay above ground very long.
The owl could tell more, if he wanted,
but he won’t. And not only that,
he’s decided he will never be seen.


2

I’m happy to honor that, but I’d like
to know what kind of owl he is.
I mean, is he blue, or is he striped
so he can blend with the forest?
Is he tall and white, from the Arctic,
or a pygmy, from further south?
Is he long-eared or spectacled? I want
to hear again the noise he made,
was it a screech, or a staccato huhuhu
followed by a deep-drawn whoo,
or did it sound like wood being sawn?
I am ashamed I paid it no attention.
I did not know then he was a messenger,
albeit a taciturn one. How does he know
me, and why is he so interested? Once
a parrot took stock of me, learnt to speak
my name in exactly the tones I said it in,
mimicked it endlessly and so loudly
that I ran from my laughing friend’s house
with my shrill-voiced name hurling after me.


3

Where does the owl go during the day?
How can he know I’ll still be here
when he surfaces? I do take trains —
I go north sometimes, pulled by my past.
I fly to places. Will he know all this
and follow me everywhere? When can I
expect his sounds to morph into spoken
words that I understand and act on,
if I agree with him? But if I decide
to stay put, never leave the bedroom,
will he get fed up standing there
and row away through the night air,
hooting a farewell? I don’t think so,
no, this fellow is here for the duration
of my stay on this enormous ball
and could tell right now how long that
will be, and what messy adventures
are still ahead of me, but his trick is
to keep as schtum on such stuff as
the wooden owl on my bedside table.


4

I’ve heard stories about owls, how they
appear from nowhere at the edge of things
to sit watching, usually staying silent,
but sometimes uttering a few words in
their night language we don’t understand.
That’s my fellow, although I don’t know him.
Should I leave the house and hold my
right arm out for him to land on and turn
his big eyes on me? As if he’d be so compliant.
Or should I try to forget him, pretend
he’s not there in the dark, like a tree
I hadn’t noticed growing? Oh, at least
I should stop mentioning him here, but what
else can I write about? Not the journey
I’m taking that I know nothing of, not yet,
and when I do I mightn’t feel like writing.
I think the solution might be to buy
a T-shirt with an owl printed on it,
a blue owl, on a yellow shirt, and write
about that small fellow to begin with.


5

What I want to learn is this: do owls
ever venture inside, to stand on a corner-
table, cock their heads to one side,
and take in completely what’s going on?
There are mice here that may be welcome,
but I know my owl would be suspicious.
He’d assume I want him inside to see
what he looks like, to make friends with him,
so he’ll be kind to me. I could promise
to wear a blindfold and say nothing,
act like I don’t know he’s there, but I will
know and that’s enough. I think I hear
his thoughts and I’m sure he hears mine.
I feel his big eyes on me all the time.
Maybe I should start carrying the wooden
owl around with me, and practice owl noises.
When is he going to tell me what he has to?
I’m not asking for a map, but I’d like to know
where I’m headed, if not where I’ll end up.
And I’d like to know it as soon as I can.


6

When I say I hear his thoughts, I hear some,
not the important ones. And here’s one
of mine — if he ventured inside this house
he’d see something that might intrigue him,
a hand-knitted toilet roll cover, in rings of
purple, red, and white. Like an unknown planet
hanging in the sky. I’d let him have it, take it
back to his nest, or his hollow tree trunk, or his
half-sunken boat. I know he’ll assume this
is another example of special pleading,
and I accept that. Would I do better to ignore
him, let him stay out there, like a pinecone
that remains unobserved? I saw my doctor
yesterday, he spoke of the deterioration,
and I felt the owl was hiding in a cupboard,
agreeing with every word. After that I went
to my sister’s grave and the owl flew back
to wherever he’s been ordered to lurk
while observing me. Maybe I should feel
privileged to have his full-time attention.


7

This morning I captured a beetle climbing
the parsley. I put him in an empty matchbox,
wondering what the owl thought of this.
Would it impact what might be unfolding?
I doubted this. I slipped on some spidery jazz
that I knew would annoy the owl. He needed
to be in control. I ground coffee beans
and made espresso. The aroma wafted through
the house. I freed the beetle to explore
the table, and when it wandered off the edge
I let it. I’m sure it survived, but I’m not bothered,
just as I know the owl doesn’t care about me.
We are thrown together, all of us, by winds
that come here from far-off worlds. I sipped
my coffee, humming the tune spun through
the jazz, and I felt quite well for the first time
in weeks, even months. Was the owl watching —
had he been in contact with the beetle?
And what was their collective verdict on me?
Did it add up to more negative evidence?


8

OK, I’m blanking him. I watched a crow today,
really admired how he operated, looking
after the young ones, his partner, none of
this spying on others. I’ve decided I don’t like
owls, their self-absorption, or their nosiness
about people. I know which I’d rather be.
And I don’t have to deal with a crow stalking me.
The owl would laugh about these thoughts.
He’s been given the task of waiting to release,
when he can, exactly what I need to know
or what he can reveal. I admit he’s not easy
but, shit, he’s the dumb card I’ve been dealt
and I have to pretend I like him. Can I ask him
about the Oxford and Cambridge rowers,
or about the hairdressers the Louisianians use,
or the tiger cubs that Texans keep as pets?
The owl would make minced meat of them all.
I wish he would hoot another noise to me.
I might even acknowledge his importance,
given my situation, but I won’t reveal anything.

9

I felt the presence of the owl last night.
He was in the room with me. Not literally —
he appeared in a dream, where a blue van
struggled up an icy road before sliding back
in a horrible, wriggling way, to what felt
like an end. I’m not sure how it seemed so.
And I can’t say where the owl was in this
little film, except he was definitely there.
This morning I came down the stairs,
expecting some sign from him. I found
a few brown feathers on a white plate
on the kitchen table. OK, then, he must be
a brown owl, but why donate some feathers,
and what did these denote? I made coffee,
then put on a CD of Anouar Brahem’s oud
that seemed to suit the moment. And I
decided it was the time to poach two eggs
to serve on top of two slices of rye bread
while I primed the espresso machine again
and asked myself what the owl was saying.

10

Those feathers were gone from the plate
when I went back for them this evening,
so I wondered if maybe I’d imagined them,
or if they’d fluttered up from the eggs
before I’d poached them. That doubt was
caused by the owl, I was sure — I’d made him
careless, and he was recovering his poise,
his control. And I was back in the place
where I knew nothing, where he liked me to be.
I opened the door and stood there, listening,
but no owl sound came. Then a bat just barely
avoided my head, and glided toward the moon.
I stood watching this leathery fellow, then
closed the door, and opened some wine.
How much did the owl control? Would I
be attacked by a rat tonight while I slept,
not savagely, but enough to terrify me?
Or would cockroaches swarm on my duvet,
clicking enough to wake me? The idea being
that these would render me so punch-drunk
I’d welcome whatever the owl had to say.


11

I spent the morning drawing owl after owl
on bits of paper, and after I’d got somewhere
near a proper depiction, I found a black marker
and reproduced it on an A2 drawing page
which I Pritt Sticked onto the gable wall, then
I dug out my old black bow and four arrows
and unleashed these into the body of the owl.
I knew I was being provocative, maybe even
launching an act of war, but I could take no
more, and couldn’t see what I had to lose.
The owl clearly was unmoved by this, so I
repeated the desecration four times over
till the drawn owl looked machine-gunned,
whereupon I flung the bow down on the grass
and went in to pour a large glass of  Talisker
for the first time in months, if not years.
It still tasted good. I slipped on Kind of Blue,
which always chilled me, and lay on the sofa
with my shoes kicked off, and the curtains
wide open. I thought, let the owl do his worst.

12

When the dark came, I lurked in the kitchen,
bow in hand, arrows in the quiver that hung
from my left shoulder, like the Robin Hood
I wanted to play in the school pantomime —
I got Little John instead! I kept looking out at
the dark garden, wondering if I should be there,
waiting to fire arrows at any sound or movement.
Why did I want to kill the owl? He hadn’t given
me the news I dreaded, but he’d stayed silent.
That was more than I could bear. I poured a
glass of Malbec and put on a CD of Baltic jazz.
Did he think I could wait forever, as if I were
a rock? I sliced some cheddar and a heel of bread,
opened the back door and went out. The moon
turned its big eye onto me, and I saw it wobble.
The stars hummed along. Where am I going?
I shouted at all of them. There was no response.
Then far off, I heard a faint huhuhu followed by
a whoo. You cowardly bastard! I roared, and
sprayed the arrows all over the blackened world.

Everyone wants to write about god but no one wants to imagine their god   as the finger trembling inside a grenade pin’s ring or the red vine of blood coughed into a child’s palm   while they cradle the head of a dying parent. Few things are more dangerous than a man   who is capable of dividing himself into several men, each of them with a unique river of desire   on their tongues. It is also magic to pray for a daughter and find yourself with an endless march of boys   who all have the smile of a motherfucker who wronged you and never apologized. No one wants to imagine their god   as the knuckles cracking on a father watching their son picking a good switch from the tree and certainly   no one wants to imagine their god as the tree. Enough with the foolishness of hope and how it bruises   the walls of a home where two people sit, stubbornly in love with the idea of staying.

When I was young, exorcisms were quite common, a remedy not unlike
ice baths. Plus, devils were shorter in those days just as people were.
They hadn't eaten enough fruits or vegetables, and lacked essential
vitamins and iron, grew thin and pale, fell easily into brooding
depressions. They looked more like deer than sheep, and when they
possessed you it was usually because they were fleeing from someone
else and didn't realize where they were until it was too late. It was more
a question of giving directions than driving them out. ""Turn right at the
hairdresser's, go straight until you get to the abandoned schoolhouse,
then turn left. You should see the exit from there."" ""Thank you. I was
completely lost."" ""You're welcome. Good luck."" ""You too, and thanks
again.""

A tool for piercing holes. Particularly in leather. A simple metal shaft. A knob of wood for handle, polished by its fit in the sinewy cradle of a leather-worker’s  palm. Likely the tool with which Louis Braille blinded himself as a child in France. An accident in his father’s saddle-making shop in the early years of the nineteenth century. Braille later invented a system of raised dots as a means of reading and writing for the blind. We don’t know much. Whether he was in the shop with his father or snuck in alone. Whether it was damp and rainy or whether the sun shone and brought to life the floating dust that always hung in the workshop air. Maybe it was just a little poke in the eye. A small tool, a small slip of the hand, a small injury. How a little fumble ends in blindness. It was decades before general anesthetic or antiseptics. Perhaps the doctor they rushed him to believed in the value of “laudable pus” in a wound. I don’t want to picture it. As a child, playing in his father’s saddle-making shop, did Louis Braille already know the names of the parts of a saddle—cantle, pommel, stirrup, tree? Did he know the smell and feel of each grade of leather? Of all the tools—punch and pincers, gouge and groover, chisel and awl—he chose awl. Likely the last thing he saw, a shine of metal galloping toward his eye. Is it accident that my tool for pressing hand-punched Braille is so much like a blunt, very small awl?

A rabbit hides in the wheel arch on a flight to hawaii
and arrives alive a poem stops a tank long enough
for a picture to be taken I myself have become more
fearful of heights the question is then what happens
the eye of jupiter is growing smaller but also colder

The movie is better than the book
which is better than the experience
silver is better than gold (it doesn’t infect piercings)
a fake masterpiece is better than a real one because at least it’s affordable
permadeath in virtual warfare is better than actual death in actual warfare
imitation is better because it’s sincere
whereas innovation seeks to impress
and anyway is never what it says it is
the second time is better than the first, as you well know!
the remake is self-conscious and therefore more morally alert
this sentiment is better than the other times it has been expressed
because in the past it was expressed more forcefully and now it can relax
even thinking that Salinger meant David Copperfield the 1980s magician
who made real cars and buildings disappear
is better than knowing he meant Dickens
but only because others have thought this before you
and written about their mistake with winning modesty
or honesty or both
a cat hunting a bird is better now
because of cartoons
just as the cat that lives next door
is a better cat because it is not your cat anymore
a rhyme is better the more times it has been used
cliché is better than truth
truth is just something that hasn’t become a cliché yet
but inevitably will
(then you can put it in your pocket
and no one can put the truth in their pocket)
and any king or queen or president or prime minister
is better than all previous kings or queens or presidents or prime ministers
any poem is better than all the poems that precede it
that say essentially the same thing
which means new is better than old
but only if it looks or sounds or otherwise seems somehow old
being in a simulation is better than being in reality
watching the simulated stars set to ambient music created by a gifted  recording artist
is better than watching real stars set to dismal sounds from real life
derivative beauty is better than any other kind
(here we are surrounded by all this derivative beauty—imagine!)
however the audience will still say “nah”
however many times you say
the cover version is better than the original
but the cover version is always better than the original
I know that the cover version is always better than the original
and the reason I know the cover version is always better than the original
is that I’ve never heard the original

You’re not the capital’s purveyor of inclement art
traversing the pale river with a glass of equally pale sulphur
on a trip in search of black ice cream
or whatever it is the russians are buying
nor an idle dealer who sports a crown of vegetables
in your self-deprecating portrait
(a little fancy commissioned
not to be indiscreet but
in the fantasy
at “some” expense)
not even the owner in your wildest dreams of a kept viper
but more a kind of overlarge boy who somehow drags out a salary
on the halved lunches of interns
hoarse from smoking
not thy powerful talk
you stay in the shop to keep in the shade that’s all
you are not the best urban poet
but this gallery has a heartless master on six figures
who likes to say he’s all mouth and isn’t
and even asks after your finances
the bastard
and why look up from your phone
at your desk at reception
when it seems you’re the only one the satire on the walls this month has seen
(it can’t cut both ways, can it?)
and nobody has ever penetrated the depths of the mercedes that waits
like a black moon
or a scoop of something poisoned
melting on the curb outside
ignored by wardens as if they can’t perceive the gleaming anomaly
so great is it
and you with your “I always had a good nose for it”
you with your aquiline sophistication and games of insolence
their verve dulling let’s be fair in these conditions
and your brochures
your spelling
just enough bait

If you want to know my wishes briefly Mark,
famous host, bright ornament, OK then, pronto—
I ask to be the master of a great rural cultivator
of the soil, a small tribe used to the easiness of dirt.
I do. And to worship the cold painted rocks at dawn
with an unfit “hello.” And later when the presents
are in stockings crowded by the chimney breast,
to remember the lead-haired fisherman I was then,
waiting a year for the prize of a red honey jar,
at a sagging table eating my eggs among ashes—
whoever does not love this does not love this life!
I hope that you live, and the city, amid duties.

What kind of life is called a healthy life...?
I don’t ask that it’s too easy or too hard.
I’d like something in between the two ...
At the same time I don’t want to know,
even if it is my call ... I know you know
I don’t wish to shave my head again
or work the funerals ... the center of attention ...
At the same time I don’t want to be bored!
Underneath the veil ... in gloves and pearls ...
W/r/t life ... that’s my prerogative ... bitches ...

Love’s syllables scroll.
Tag them, Verona.
May is a happy man.
Consider pressed his tiny region.
Place the stars or less.
Fragrant hues applaud the Nile.
One tree sounds.
Love, the two unique dogs.
He speaks fluent hearts.
A dog can enjoy his humorous letter.
No one has bought cilantro, my arse.
Your lie, my boast.
I will not keep silent in the lawsuit, Bilbo.

63.

In general I hate discussing my poetry
so I always ask questions
there’s a kind of writer/artist though
and you meet them all the time now
who only talks about their “practice”
without anyone caring or asking
(it isn’t connected to success)
and shows no flicker of interest
in anything anyone else does
if the choice is between talking about me
when I don’t want to talk about me
or talking about you
when you only want to talk about you
then let’s talk about me
by the way if you don’t know
this type of artist you probably are it sorry

I told the doctor I wouldn’t be seeing him again. “No, I guess you won’t,” he said. I walked out the door feeling really good. Of course I knew I was going to die, but still the day looked bright to me. I walked down to the water. Ducks were circling around and about. A sailboat sailed by. I walked along the shore. The sun beat down on me. I felt as though I might live forever. I sat down on a bench and watched the joggers pass. A pretty blonde walked by and I said, “Hello.” She looked at me and said hello. A man with a greyhound on a leash walked by. I got up and started to walk. A woodpecker was pounding on a tree. An airplane flew over, leaving a thick trail of smoke. I left the lake and walked on up the road. I crossed at the streetlights and crossed the bridge. A car swerved to miss me. I thought, that could have been it, the end right there, but I walked on, bravely dodging the cars. When I got to the residential district, I felt relieved. There were large elms and maples overhanging the street, and people pushing baby carriages. Dogs ran loose everywhere. A man stopped me and asked if I knew where 347 Walnut Street was. I said I didn’t. He said, “Oh well, it didn’t matter anyway.” I said, “Why?” He said it was a funeral notice. I walked on, bumping into a fat lady with a load of groceries. I said I was sorry. She kept going, dropping a load of grapefruit. Then, further on, there was a giant explosion across the street. Police and firemen were there right away. It appears it was a gas main beneath the shop. No one was there, luckily, but the firetrucks had their hands full. I left before it was out. The shop was pretty much destroyed. When I got home I was tired. I made myself a cup of tea and sat down on the couch. I thought about calling my mother, but she was in heaven. I called her anyway. “Mom, how are you doing?” I said. “I’m bored. Don’t come here. There’s nothing to do,” she said. “Aren’t there angels?” I said. “Yes, but they’re boring,” she said. “But I was going to come see you,” I said. “Go to hell, it’s more exciting,” she said. I had fallen asleep with my teacup in my hand. When I awoke I realized I had thought it was a phone. My mother would never be so sarcastic about heaven.
I told the doctor I wouldn’t be seeing him again. “No, I guess you won’t,” he said. I walked out the door feeling really good. Of course I knew I was going to die, but still the day looked bright to me. I walked down to the water. Ducks were circling around and about. A sailboat sailed by. I walked along the shore. The sun beat down on me. I felt as though I might live forever. I sat down on a bench and watched the joggers pass. A pretty blonde walked by and I said, “Hello.” She looked at me and said hello.

Learning not to mourn what I make

It’s a complex     this gravity I birth unknowing

Inherited from a horizon claimed before

I was languaged     Invoke the historical

Somethingsomethingsomething Chains

Somethingsomethingsomething Unworthy

I’m citizen of a clumsy imperative

Belonging     is a concern of a self   I deaded

Past participle implies the historical is a mob

Try again     I mobbed my own lonely and was legion

Play some offense then     Gold the impossible wound

Citizen of  betrayal     Citizen of the going going going —

Recursion     this fugitive state as native to me as my father’s

Eyes     chestnut of a tree felled before we were languaged

See   Inheritance is a hell of a drug     We Black and highly valued

For our Flex     I said what I said     and became citizen

Of  this petty excuse for forever     Flex on ’em then

Invocation of the bicep I have and the bicep throttling me

I live here now     Mississippi     and everywhere is everywhere

That someone may have escaped from     Fugitive

A sad motivation for river     It’s a strange thing

That belief you are beautiful be a subversion of the water

But here I am     winter gasping at the conditions

Too weak to even strangle the grass to soil     No instead

Trees feathered with their hollowed offspring

Here the wind don’t howl just blooms a militia

Of castanets     seven people were lynched here

I looked it up and nobody will tell me which tree

You are not as tired of the image as I am of uncertainty

Every day the rain threatens     Every day my same imperious lonely

Hear me     the sun ran like a punk     the sun ran like it owed

Not even the gold     is trustworthy     why gold?

Because it was the color of my love     and by extension

The life I buried here     Gold the genesis of one lonely

My ancestors were traded mere miles from here     Gold the genesis

Of  another     I know they are not the same in anything but geography

Still it is an act of   Flex just to stand anywhere     gravity being what it is

Attempt the volta toward impossible     Midas the lonely into a radif

Dreams of living life like a gilded garrote

Flex

The crown of scar tissue still the crown

Flex

Go to therapy if  you scared

Flex

Shuck the fear out of  the opposition

Flex

Every day gold for the sake of your attention

Flex

Your hereness a mountain plumed with trees

Branches hemmed like unplayed notes

A history can be undone with less than an alphabet

Amend the scandal of the time that brought you here

Fled to Flex     Ex. My family fled from Mississippi

My family Flexed from Mississippi     and you become

The muscle driving you forward     See     you were ugly

Once     because you believed it     Dire invocation

I am some kind of unkillable and don’t know how to act

Everything I said I couldn’t live without

Gone

Lucky me     to be born into a language of mistakes

I leave the violent on Seen and watch them wither

Turns out I was their gravity     their forgetful sovereign

I Flex     they flinch     the sonics of the words     cousins

By virtue of a pistol     This is how I was taught to bridle

Sadness like an American     Run with a band of  kids

With silver caps     so you know we bad     waiting for the bone

Eviction     Flex like value native to your mouth     Tooth out

A tiny moon     a second grin shimmering in your palm     Flex

The loss     the cost is secondary   Hear me     a life I had ended

While I was trying to pursue the life I wanted     by pursuing

A loss cobwebbed as a bride     All of this true the calcium winnowing

Under the gold     I widowed my own comfort     I am in danger

My squad an echo     my squad a promise you get dead someday

If you touch me     thus I’m untouched     Neglect killed the grass

The dead turn to gold before they resurrect     I am framed

By a pastoral I might have escaped once     O the history

O the lineage     the renowned Flex of survivors     I’m here

I’m back     muscled like a creek          or the whisper

That threads a storm miles later     Maybe not     Stick to the facts

I’m alive despite a growing and planetary grief     I wear a chain

Somedays     and a sweatshirt that translates to     I Am Coming

Back For What Is Mine     Gaudy surprise on the faces of children

Of owners     They think I am impossible     They think I am a ghost

I Medusa like my daddy taught me     their eyes wilt and are

Ill-tended grapes consumed by the skull     I’m metaphoring

I told you     I don’t know how to act     but I know how to anthem

My lyric loose and I got time today     I’m the type of  bad

In Madrid I orient myself     I walk on the wide boulevards
and know an empire is its boulevards     I stand below the angel


skeptical of the beauty of angels     at the royal gardens I count
the 138 kinds of dahlias     at the crystal palace I imagine


the exhibition of plants indigenous to my islands     I walk
up the street of the poets     read the bronze lines on the ground


the longing and song of the pirate     in one museum I stare
at Picasso’s lightbulb     in the oldest neighborhoods


I wonder if  José Rizal walked these streets     studying diseases
of the eye during the day     writing his novel in the night


in another museum I look     at the paintings of the dwarves
of  the horses     of  the undying fruit     in the train station


I visit the memorial for the murdered     in the great white
square at dawn I walk     inscribe myself  like letters on a page


at the naval museum I look into the face of  Magellan     show the
painting my face     I sing the neighborhoods of Huertas


and Chueca     maybe only in Madrid     is the light a gold
weight always     at the supermarket I overhear     two Filipinos


speaking and I turn away and break     I find myself in
the cathedral     in the movie theater     where I watch a movie

dear suicide

how is the war? is it eating?
tell me of the girls charging
backwards into dumb tides
death’s wet mouth lapping
their ankles, knees, eyebrows.
tell me of the sissies like drunk
fireworks, rocketing into earth
afterimage burned into river
& cement memory.
how is the war? does it have
a wife? does she know how
the bodies got in her bed?

dear suicide

i know your real name.
i bind you from doing harm.
i enter the room like a germ.
i say your name, it is my name.
the walls cave around me like a good aunt.
the window hums. the door rocks me.
the dresser leaves to go make tea.
the room knows my name.
it binds us from doing harm.

dear suicide

where are you keeping my friends?
every cup i turn over holds only air.
i jimmy open a tulip expecting their faces
but find only the yellow heart.
what have you done with them?
yesterday i took my body off
beat it on the front steps with a broom
& not one of them
came giggling out my skin
yelling you found me!
not one of them i called for
was already in my hand.

dear suicide

you a mutual friend
a wedding guest, a kind
of mother, a kind of self
love, a kind of freedom.
i wish you were a myth
but mothers my color
have picked ocean
over boat, have sent
children to school
in rivers. i known niggas
who just needed
quiet. i seen you
dance, it made me hard.
i would not deny you
what others have found
in the sweet mildew
behind your ear. i know
what happens when you
ask for a kiss, it’s all
tongue, you don’t
unlatch, you suck
face until the body
is gone.

dear suicide

that one? i promised him
i would kill for him
& my nigga was my nigga
& my word is my word.
dear suicide, where are you?
come see me. come outside.
i am at your door, suicide.
i’ll wait. i’ve offed my earrings
& vaselined my face. i put on
my good sweats for this.
i brought no weapon but my fist.

dear suicide

you made my kin thin air.
his entire body dead as hair.
you said his name like a dare.
you’ve done your share.
i ride down lake street friendbare
to isles of lakes, wet pairs
stare back & we compare
our mirror glares. fish scare
into outlines, i blare
a moon’s wanting, i wear
their faces on t-shirts, little flares
in case i bootleg my own prayer
& submit to your dark affair.
tell me they’re in your care.
be fair.

How hard it is to sleep

— Audre Lorde


We wake in the middle of a life,                    hungry. We smear durian            along our mouths, sing soft death a lullaby. Carcass breath, eros of  licked fingers and the finest perfume. What is love if  not         rot? We wear the fruit’s hull as a spiked crown, grinning in green armor.   Death to the grub, fat in his milky shuffle! Death to the lawlessness       of dirt! Death to mud and its false chocolate!   To the bloated sun we want to slice open and yolk                      all over the village. We want a sun-drenched           slug feast, an omelet loosening its folds like hot Jell-O. We want the marbled fat of steak and all        its swirling pink galaxies. We want the drool, the gnash, the pluck of each corn kernel, raw and summer                   swell. Tears welling up                     oil. Order up! Pickled cucumbers piled like logs for a fire, like fat limbs we pepper and succulent                in. Order up: shrimp chips curling in a porcelain bowl like subway seats. Grapes peeled from bitter bark — almost translucent, like eyes we would rather see. Little girl, what do you leave, leaven              in your sight? Death to the open eyes of  the dying. Here,           there are so many open eyes we can’t close each one.          No, we did not say the steamed eye of a fish. No eyelids fluttering like no butterfly wings. No purple yam lips. We said eyes. Still and resolute as a heartbreaker.         Does this break your heart?                                      Look, we don’t want to be rude, but seconds, please. Want: globes of oranges swallowed whole like a basketball or Mars or whatever planet is the most delicious.                   Slather Saturn! Ferment Mercury! Lap up its film of dust, yuk sung! Seconds, thirds, fourths! Meat wool! A bouquet of chicken feet! A garden of                   melons, monstrous in their bulge!               Prune back nothing. We purr in this garden. We comb through berries and come out so blue. Little girl,                            lasso tofu, the rope slicing its belly clean. Deep fry a cloud so it tastes like bitter gourd or your father leaving — the exhaust of his car, charred. Serenade a snake and slither its tongue into yours and                           bite. Love! What is love if  not knotted in garlic? Child, we move through graves like eels, delicious         with our heads first, our mouths agape. Our teeth:         little needles to stitch a factory of everything made in China.      You ask: Are you hungry? Hunger eats through the air like ozone. You ask: What does it mean to be rootless? Roots are good to use as toothpicks. You: How can you wake in the middle of a life? We shut and open our eyes like the sun shining on tossed pennies in a forgotten well. Bald copper, blood. Yu choy bolts                  into roses down here. While you were sleeping, we woke to the old leaves of  your backyard shed and ate that and one of your lost flip-flops too. In a future life, we saw rats overtake a supermarket with so much milk, we turned opaque. We wake to something boiling. We wake to wash dirt from lettuce, to blossom into your face.

I still keep it hidden in the jar of  saltwater you gave me     don’t worry, no one can hear me, my husband’s in the bathroom & my daughter’s in her bedroom wearing those headphones made of sponges on her ears
yes, I’ve kept it all these years, and kept it hidden, but — I have to tell you something:
something about it has changed
recently     has changed     since the last time we talked     the shell has opened, and — 
calm down      please      I’m about to tell you     I’ve waited years to tell you     how?     how could I have called you?     I don’t know where you live: I don’t even know your name!
so     I’m telling you now: the gluey seam that held it closed     at some point it began to dissolve     I don’t know     around Christmastime, I suppose     but it was gradual     subtle     not something easily seen through water, through glass      so perhaps it started earlier than that, but that’s when I first noticed — 
(of course it’s still alive     I know because I know)

A man calling from a balcony is not to be trusted


In 1988, the nation sings a song I can’t understand but I sing it  because everyone looks at me like a thief and no one likes a thief


Algae gather in plastic cups along the Jersey Shore


The dull prongs of a fork still count as a weapon


I gather plastic cups along the shore and shake them out to use for tea, juice, a home for my toothbrush


The pledge of allegiance is a building ledge, an alleged crime, a leg crossed over another leg, a plea gone askew, a glance shared in a room with someone else who looks like you


Hundreds of toxic wild boars are roaming across northern Japan and it would be a mistake to identify with them


In 1960, my grandmother holds no knife in no tall wheat

When we look at each other, we also look away, knowingly


I am a good daughter and I can repeat this indefinitely without  taking a breath


Often, I call out to myself just to hear an echo, to hear something moving in the walls like a healthy family of rats


My mother has been told, repeatedly: “You cannot walk here”


Here is a white stone, a white fence, a white seagull, a white jug of milk, a white candle, a white duvet, a white patio, a white bar of soap to wash your mouth out


Sometimes I dream in Cantonese and I have no idea what is being said


You grow to love what you create, pouring out of your mouth


In 1988, my father sees his reflection in the rearview mirror and identifies with the blood moon lighting his way to Atlantic City


From a balcony, a man yells at me: “You need some white dick” and I turn into a boar


我 在 广 东 做 梦


My father disappears for weeks and my mother keeps weeding the garden, pulling cigarettes from the splintering tomatoes I will devour


I study asymptotes for months and dream in curves — almost but never touching


My mother writes in her English diary for night school: “I hate him I hate him I hate him I hate him I” and her ESL teacher only gives her a check, so I give her a check plus


To be a good daughter means to carry everything with you at all times, the luggage of the past lifted to the mouth


When we look at each other, my mother laughs like an overripe tomato on a windowsill


In 1989, I spent months assembling a puzzle map of the United States of America and the teacher said, “Good job, Jane” and then louder and slower like a drowning sloth: “Gooooood jooooob, Jane” and I did not touch a single piece

你 是 一 只 美 丽 的 野 猪


During elementary school, I did not say a single word, not even when called on, and thus the teachers and administrators  decided I could not speak English because they looked at me

At the confluence of tea roses and Russian sage
we made a right at the curved iron fence,
one of my dead friends beside me explaining how trees communicated
but I couldn’t understand a thing because it was all blurry —
the way it gets — and though I knew him well
I couldn’t say for sure now whether it was Larry or
Phil or Galway or Charlie until I realized it was me
talking in some kind of Hebrish they spoke
in my town by the Delaware and it was used
for code the way one of the Amerindian languages
was used in World War II the Germans couldn’t in a
million years break since they weren’t as pragmatic
irrational and in-your-face as the English and Americans were.

I noticed the bees were digging in for a late lunch
of what for them was boiled beef and horseradish
or maybe it was just for me and they were bent over
guzzling madly while paying no attention to the two
of us or in any way tired of the nectars since it
ran the whole gamut from oysters to soup to — well —
boiled beef to strawberry-rhubarb pie
and a little whisky after, some of it spilled on the
vanilla ice cream that underlaid the pie it had once overlaid,
all of this depending on the blossoms they circled over
and bent down upon, a cafeteria as good as the one
on Broadway called Stanley’s I circled and bent over
expending nickels dimes and quarters when the Dulles brothers
ran the country.

It was Larry, I’m sure now,
and what we talked about was cardboard
and we were amazed that in the open spaces
beside the hotel on 47th Street
there were four or five small cardboard “houses,”
both of us remembered,
the homeless had claimed to sleep in and provide
a safe place for their black plastic garbage bags,
the size of a room at the Sloane House on 34th Street
near the Pennsylvania Station where I put up
the price of a meal then for a clean pillowcase
with little or no stuffing and a cardboard
bed as stiff as metal and a cardboard
breakfast of cardboard bread and eggs and between us
we talked cardboard, shirts from the cleaners with sheets of
cardboard we drew on, cardboard soles in ruined shoes
we both wore when we were children, cardboard hats,
cardboard to lie on listening to outdoor concerts
and cardboard masks we made with scissors and crayon
for costume dances, balls is what we called them
as if we were art students in Paris about to
swim in the nearest fountain.

Though what I want to
say is the bees were too busy to do us any
harm and it was packs of wild dogs, not swarms
of bees, that terrified me (Larry, too) except for one
occasion when I pushed the wrong end of an old
broom into a hive of yellow jackets on the underside
of a low-lying garage roof and an angry swarm chased
me through the yard and over a fence hating
any form of criminal intrusion, urban renewal, or
gentrification, I who couldn’t resist intrusions,
who never could, omnivorous as I was, living on
apples and bananas as well as baby lamb chops,
who ran like hell that day (Larry, too)
for we in our separate ways didn’t want to be
paralyzed then eaten by larvae, none of us dead ones did.

His wife recently left him. He's lonely.
We're both carpenters, a couple of old guys in baseball caps
plying the trade.
We can frame a wall and hang a door, we can
read a set of blueprints.
But when it comes to women . . .

I'm thinking about my mother, who is 91
and very frail. I'm thinking
about my wife, my daughters, my granddaughter,
my sister, old girlfriends, my ex-wife,
and the girl from Panama
in the reading room of the New Orleans public library
forty-five years ago
who slipped a note to me across the table, asking:
""Are you a philosophy?""

Rain splatters against the storefront
of the coffee shop. Mike and I are silent
for a long time
before going back to work.

She's nine, same age I was watching my mother pick my favorite one, shaped like a flower a child might draw, color of sunshine. Her homemaker hands held everything together, needle and red thread lickety-splitting up, over, down, up again attaching the blossom to grass- green cloth: Colors no bee could pass by. Now, before the last tug of thread through the button my granddaughter brought me, I point out the pinch of space—width of a scissor-blade—between it and the fabric, a shaft of stitches with a half-dozen twists of thread around it before tying off. Shank, I tell her, same as Mother named it. It strengthens the bond between button and garment, less friction than ready-mades, fasteners that loosen too soon. Like love, my mother said. Close, but not tooclose. A snip of thread and my granddaughter's ready to go, fluorescent-pink button back on the nose of her dog-faced school bag, the shank fixing us together in this world my mother could trust only so long as everything was done right, only when she didn't forget to check I was buttoned upproper, buttoned up tight.

When I came to this mountainside almost fifty years ago it never occurred to me that there would be an end to it.         I went along never thinking about the time when I would have to quit. I imagined—I guess — all this would last forever, if I imagined it at all. Now I'm in my seventies and all I can think about is the time when my life will be here no more.
         For example, I love being in the woods felling and bucking hardwood trees, stacking and covering the blocks, then a year or two later, hauling them to the woodshed where I stack them again, and split them all winter long into the right size for the weather—then bring them into the house.         Now this chore I love so much is seriously painful, and I can see, now, an end to it.

Forehead still bowed to forehead—
Nothing was lost, nothing possessed

The song, and the words waiting for music.

Go from mine to the other.

Be together; eat, dance, despair,
Sleep, be threatened, endure.
You will know the way of that.

Wear the bloom from silence.

Her sister was shot, and hers found bludgeoned
dead in her car trunk; her mother was alcoholic,
and hers a suicide; her daughter killed by an uncle,
and hers stayed alive thanks to prison.
Before the term, date-raped, she was. Before
domestic violence, love punched her face.

We wanted the career. Not just skills and money,
but structure, focus, printed plans, the rowdy order
of raising buildings that years later would still stand
right where you left them. We joined a tradition,
expected a well-marked path and a welcome.
The earnest ads never mentioned

we’d be human minesweepers steering around
barricades, sinkholes, lethal instructions, We learned
Solidarity was a corporation privately held.
Some left in shock. Some were maimed.
Some went missing. A few found gold.

Those with talent for sifting real threat from bluff,
or detecting hair-triggers before the blast, fared best,
We taught ourselves to disarm booby traps, shared
hand-drawn maps, and prepared for a long winter.
We lied on postcards home.

Deftly. So no one’s certain for absolute that’s what happened. Not even you.
Everything you thought you knew
must be relearned overnight.

How to walk.
Walk, not trip, over cords, 2x4s,
used coffee cups, concrete cores.
Walk, 40 pounds on your shoulder, across
rebar or a wood plank; glide,
not wobble, not look like the bounce
beneath each bootstep scares you.

How to dress yourself
to work outdoors all day midwinter
and keep warm, keep working, fingers moving;
or midsummer, with no hint of breasts.

How to climb ladders–
not a stepstool or a 4-footer–
ladders that stretch up two stories
where someone’s impatient
for that bundle of pipe.

How to get coffee–
hot and how they like it–to a crew
spread out 10 floors; to carry muffins
three blocks in a paper sack
through sheets of rain.

How to look.
To never go back empty-handed
when you’re told, Grab me a This/That
from the gangbox, if all you’ve done
is move things around, poke here and there;
if you haven’t emptied out the full contents
so the journeyman won’t shame you
by finding This/That in a quick minute,
after you’ve said, We don’t have any.

How to be dependable
but not predictable-provokable.
Not the lunch break entertainment.

How to read
blueprints,
delivery orders,
the mood on the job;
how long it’s okay to sit down for coffee;
how early you can start rolling up cords.

How to do well in school
from the back row
of a seats-assigned-Jim-Crow classroom
How to learn tricks-of-the-trade
from someone who does not like you.

How to listen, to act-don’t-ask.
To duck when someone motions, Duck!
Or when someone tells you, Don’t talk to Zeke,
to know what they mean
so you don’t even look
at Zeke, the ironworker who’s always first out,
last in, standing there, so four times a day–
start, lunch, quit–all the workers walk past him,
like a sandbar, waves washing back and forth,
that catches debris.

How to pick up the phone and call your friend,
the only one of the women not at class
the night the apprenticeship director met you all
at the door
carrying the nervous rumor
that one of the women had been raped
and you all look at each other
and it wasn’t any of you five.

How to respond–within protocol–
when someone takes your ladder or tools,
imitates your voices on the loudspeaker,
spraypaints Cunt on your Baker staging,
urinates in your hardhat,
drives to your home
where you live alone
with your daughter
and keys your truck parked
in your own driveway.

Later, you’ll need the advanced skills:
how–without dislodging the keystone–
to humiliate a person, how to threaten
a person. Deftly.
So no one’s certain for absolute
that’s what happened. Not even you.

that time Mo almost lost an arm
after I convinced him to pay me
twenty bucks to stitch his wound

The gully accordion, their arms sway in & out of tempo with traffic. They stagger in & out of the busted frame of Pop’s Grocery neon-blue open sign. Their smoke-thin throats glitter when they slip into the ringing center of the motel lobby. Strangled light bubbles & soaps along their jaws like melted crayons through the Plexiglas. A rush of shade strains against their nylon-clamped thighs, rides up their hips & dangles around their soft bellies as they saunter on in. They be harvested sounds for the replay later this evening. When they got to make it do what it do. When they got to cash they own checks. Trace dollar signs into ceilings — signals cut with their zirconia-encrusted toes. Giggle & grunt at all the right moments for the Best in Show.

cash they own checks. Trace dollar signs into ceilings — signals

cut with their zirconia-encrusted toes.
Giggle & grunt at all the right moments
for the Best in Show.

I was eight when the blackout struck and the lights died all across the city like a massacre of fireflies. In the projects of Brooklyn, I steered myself to 14F, fingers spread against the cool tiles of the hallway, past the concrete and chicken-wire terrace where I once burnt ants with a magnifying glass. Many years later, at the Chinese restaurant uptown, Jack said: They got any flan here? He was my first poet. I had seen the fireflies in his sonnets blink and float away: Fulano the philosopher in the unemployment line; Blanco the painter, painting in the madhouse; Monterosa the dealer killed by shotgun in a bar on Avenue A; his mother the seamstress and the quick needle of her sewing machine; Jack the moving man, his hands sliced raw. He stacked his apartment with dictionaries in three languages. I knew the raconteur’s grin with every tale: Raúl Juliá is a friend of mine:a Puerto Rican playing Macbeth. He took 14 curtain calls on opening night. Maybe he would tell me now that flan was not Puerto Rican, or Mexican, or Spanish, but Chinese, invented by a trembling cook to satisfy the palate of an emperor in the Ming Dynasty. No flan, Jack, I said. This is a Chinese restaurant. Two minutes later, he said: They got any flan? I showed him the dog-eared and fingerprinted menu. No flan, I said. When the waiter unfurled his pad, Jack said to him: You got flan? He sang this song for an hour. The egg roll was not flan. The fried rice was not flan. The fortune cookie was not flan. Can we get some flan? he said. Goddammit, Jack, I said. The poets crowded into the bar, striding to the mic. Jack stood with poem in hand, read the title, tilted his head and said it again, studied the page as if the words shriveled up like ants burnt under a magnifying glass, then sat down. I witnessed the massacre of fireflies. A few of us clapped, not knowing what to do with our hands, staring at the sonneteer who lost all his quatrains and couplets in the denim jacket he left on the subway, the words of Fulano still waiting on the unemployment line: The faster you spin, the stiller you look. / There’s something to learn in that, but what? After the diagnosis, I handed Jack a book of poems. He dangled the book upside down like a stiff mouse by the tail, something we would sniff  behind the refrigerator. I wanted sonnets. Jack kept singing the chorus of a song:Get me to the church. Get me to the church. Get me to the church on time.  At the end, I leaned over Jack’s bed to read his own poem in his ear, but some words come home after the blackout, fingers crawling on the wall. I know what I should have said at the Chinese restaurant: Jack, let’s get some flan. We should have braved the subway at rush hour, straphangers rocking all the way to 14th Street and 8th Avenue, to La Taza de Oro, gone now like Jack, for rice and beans, squid in its own ink, café con leche y flan, Jack: a spoonful of flan for you after all the years of sonnets and bread for me, the steam rising when your hands cracked the crust at the table.

1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"Jumping Off the Mystic Tobin Bridge
By Martín Espada
By Martín Espada
I close my eyes and see him windmilling his arms as he plummets from the Mystic Tobin Bridge, to prove me wrong, to show me he was good, to atone for sins like seeds in the lopsided apple of his heart, but mostly to escape from me in the back of his cab, a Puerto Rican lawyer in a suit and tie. I hated the 111 bus, sweltering in my suit and tie with the crowd in the aisle, waiting to hit a bump on the Mystic Tobin Bridge so my head would finally burst through the ceiling like a giraffe on a circus train. I hated the 111 bus after eviction day in Chelsea District Court, translating the landlords and judges into Spanish so the tenants knew they had to stuff their clothing into garbage bags and steal away again, away from the 40-watt squint that followed them everywhere, that followed me because I stood beside them in court. I would daydream in the humidity of the bus, a basketball hero, flipping the balled-up pages of the law into the wastebasket at the office as the legal aid lawyers chanted my name. I hated the 111 bus. I had to take a taxicab that day.What the hell you doing here? said the driver of the cab to me in my suit and tie. You gotta be careful in this neighborhood. There’s a lotta Josésaround here. The driver’s great-grandfather staggered off a boat so his great-grandson could one day drive me across the Mystic Tobin Bridge, but there was no room in the taxi for chalk and a blackboard. He could hear the sawing of my breath as I leaned into his ear, past the bulletproof barricade somehow missing, and said: I’m a José. I could see the 40-watt squint in his rearview mirror. I’m Puerto Rican, I said. It was exactly 5 pm, and we were stuck in traffic in a taxi on the Mystic Tobin Bridge. The driver stammered his own West Side Story without the ballet, how a Puerto Rican gang stole his cousin’s wallet years ago. You think I’m gonna rob you? I said, in my suit and tie, close enough now to tickle his ear with the mouth of a revolver. I could hear the sawing of his breath. He still wanted to know what I was doing there. I’m a lawyer. I go to court with all the Josés, I said. Stalled traffic steamed around us, the breath of cattle in the winter air. Where you going for the holidays? the driver said. I thought about Christmas Eve in court, eviction orders flying from the judge’s bench when tenants without legal aid lawyers, or children old enough to translate the English of the summons, did not answer to their names. Every year, the legal aid lawyers told the joke about the Christmas Defense: Your honor, it’s Christmas! I said to the driver: I will be spending Christmas right here with my fellow Josés. The driver shouted: What do you want me to do? Get out of this cab and jump off the bridge? We both knew what he meant. We both knew about Chuck Stuart, the last man to jump off the Mystic Tobin Bridge. Everybody knew how Chuck drove his wife to Mission Hill after birthing classes, the ash and pop in the dark when he shot her in the head and himself in the belly. Everybody knew how he conjured a Black carjacker on the crackling call to 911 the way the Mercury Theatre on the Air conjured Martians in New Jersey on the radio half a century before. Everybody knew how a hundred cops pounded on door after door in the projects of Mission Hill, locking a Black man in a cage for the world to see like the last of his tribe on exhibit at the World’s Fair. Everybody knew how Chuck would have escaped, cashing the insurance check to drive away with a new Nissan, but for his brother’s confession, the accomplice throwing the Gucci bag with makeup, the wedding rings, and the gun off the Dizzy Bridge in Revere. Everybody knew how Chuck parked his new car on the lower deck, left a note and launched himself deep into the black water, how the cops hauled his body from the river by lunchtime, when I walked into the office to tell the secretary: Chuck Stuart just jumped off the Mystic Tobin Bridge. I said nothing to the driver. I almost nodded yes in the rearview mirror. I confess, for a flash, I wanted him to jump. The driver, the cops, the landlords, the judges all wanted us to jump off the Mystic Tobin Bridge, all wanted us to sprout gills like movie monsters so we could paddle underwater back to the islands, down into the weeds and mud at the bottom, past the fish-plucked ribcages of the dead, the rusty revolvers of a thousand crimes unsolved, the wedding rings of marriages gone bad, till we washed up onshore in a tangle of seaweed, gasping for air. Last night, still more landed here, clothing stuffed in garbage bags, to flee the god of hurricanes flinging their houses into the sky or the god of hunger slipping his knife between the ribs, not a dark tide like the tide of the Mystic River, but builders of bridges. You can walk across the bridges they build. Or you can jump.

Then I cry & need to say: no-no-no.
Why does it take so long to reply?
I FOMO & shout. I read. I never
enough. New book. New post.
New ping. A new tab, then another.
Papers on the floor, scattered & stacked.
So many journals, unbroken white spines,
waiting. Did you hear that new new?
I start to text back. Ellipsis, then I forget.
I balk. I lazy the bed. I wallow when I write.
I truth when I lie. I throw a book
when a poem undoes me. I underline
Clifton: today we are possible. I start
from image. I begin with Phillis Wheatley.
I begin with Phillis Wheatley. I begin
with Phillis Wheatley reaching for coal.
I start with a napkin, receipt, or my hand.
I muscle memory. I stutter the page. I fail.
Hit delete — scratch out one more line. I sonnet,
then break form. I make tea, use two bags.
Rooibos again. I bathe now. Epsom salt.
No books or phone. Just water & the sound
of water filling, glory — be my buoyant body,
bowl of me. Yes, lavender, more bubbles
& bath bomb, of course some candles too.
All alone with Coltrane. My favorite, “Naima,”
for his wife, now for me, inside my own womb.
Again, I child back. I float. I sing. I simple
& humble. Eyes close. I low my voice,
was it a psalm? Don’t know. But I stopped.

Looking out at a man’s name on a battered wingtip in strong winds; was it planned that when the cheap wing bends, the name stays steady? What if it didn’t matter how much you trod over the body of your mother, what happened when you were younger, how you tried forgetting and forgot to forgive. Something has to hold you: numbers, columns, cards to swipe, books to shelve, pints to pour. A life filled with fixed wings, with hard grasps, with the grateful. What’s worth keeping? Not the sad boy who blamed you for all the ways he was broken. Not the man’s name on the wing, but why not the battered wing itself. Why not the woman thinking. Why not the river below, its lips wet, footprints animal. What forked tongues come when clouds crack open, when this sky’s watched you sleep all day, and now lets down its darkness. There’s all night to stay awake.

I come from the nether regions

They serve me pomegranate seeds with morsels of flying fish

From time to time I wear a crown of blood streaked grass.


Mama beat me when I was a child for stealing honey from a honey pot

It swung from the rafters of the kitchen.

Why I stuffed my mouth with golden stuff, no one could tell.


King Midas wore a skin that killed him.

My nails are patterned ebony, Doxil will do that

They made a port under my collar bone with a plastic tube that runs into a blood vessel.



I set out with mama from Bombay harbor.

Our steamer was SS Jehangir, in honor of the World Conqueror —

They say he knelt on the battle field to stroke the Beloved’s shadow.


The waves were dark in Bombay harbor, Gandhi wrote in his Autobiography

Writing too is an experiment with truth.

No one knows my name in Arabic means port.


On board white people would not come near us

Were they scared our brown skin would sully them?

Mama tried to teach me English in a sing song voice.


So you can swim into your life she said.

Wee child, my language tutor muttered ruler in hand, ready to strike,

Just pronounce the words right:


Pluck, pluck             Suck, suck


Duck, duck


Stuck, stuck.

between the north and south continent,
you come across a chain of volcanoes,

a coast with a thick growth of palm trees,
crunching waves of the sea; an isthmus
Neruda called “slender earth like a whip.”

When the road bends, turns into a street,
the walls splattered with “Yanqui Go Home!!!”
you see a boy fifteen years old,

barefoot, sniffing glue in a small plastic bag.
An old woman in an apron will step out,
say, “This is the right street.”

from school to welcome you, no drive

no one to order cold Pilseners, oyster
cocktails, or convince the waitress
into dancing a cumbia or two with you.

Instead, at the local bar, you’ll raise
a bottle next to strangers, stub
your cigarette out on the floor.

You’ll watch a country ten years
after the civil war: an old man sitting
on the curb, head between knees,

open hand stretched out.
Everything will hurt, your hair,
your toenails, even your shoes.

You’ll curse dusty streets, demented
sun slowly burning the nape of your neck,
stray dogs following you to the park.

By nightfall, you drag yourself back to the bars,
looking for a lost country in a shot of Tíc Táck.
Against the wall, three men with their guitars.

At the top of a hill each morning, I wait for the bus by the donut store. Its pink sign looks hot, curls, like a rope, a stem to a brain. You turn toward a jade at the height of your neighborhood, stop at a light in its gut. The sun starts to seep up, reaching all grasses and grooves of the city. A white bus with black windows passes. A few minutes later, the city bus arrives like a room. It crawls warm and dull to the west edge, breathing its heat, a few baby hands warming wide glass. The billboard at my stop displays a large number to call. A man walks his sniffing dog below it, sharp legs brushing wild onion. At the base of the hill, I enter my code, push the gray gate open, allow the worn loop of my bag down my arm, walk to my station. I drop the metal end of a hose into a bucket, turn the tough faucet. Traveling after the sound, the cold rushes out full force from the rubber, breaking into itself, interrupting and filling the round plastic space. Hungry, I pick up the water.

reaching all grasses and grooves of the city.
A white bus with black windows passes.
A few minutes later, the city bus arrives like a room.
It crawls warm and dull to the west edge,
breathing its heat, a few baby hands
warming wide glass.
The billboard at my stop displays a large number to call.
A man walks his sniffing dog below it,
sharp legs brushing wild onion.
At the base of the hill,
I enter my code,
push the gray gate open,
allow the worn loop of my bag
down my arm, walk to my station.
I drop the metal end of a hose
into a bucket, turn the tough faucet.
Traveling after the sound,
the cold rushes out
full force from the rubber,
breaking into itself, interrupting and filling
the round plastic space.
Hungry, I pick up the water.

Here, an English fort, a few farmers.
And here the industrialist settled his ass,
John Ford on the river dredging sand
for making glass. Plate glass.
(Why should America buy from Europe?)
Some half dozen years, German engineers, and hundreds of Slavic peasants.

Grandfather sat on his samovar
warming himself and making excuses,
but finally, he set off.
Got a room, became a shoveler.
Got a wife, a company house.
Ford City: a valley filling with properties.

Not Labor and Capital, not Germans and Slavs,
not husband and wives, for that matter.

Edward’s castles were ruins
by the fifteenth century. Not from Welsh armies,
but the rise of the middle class.
The towns around a castle thrived:
tailors, smithies, cobblers, coopers.
Drawing in the Welsh peasants.
And what with intermarriage and the rise of capitalism…
a castle grew obsolescent.

I turn off the set. My father hunts
cigarettes at the Kwik-Mart on the corner.
Overhead, my mother’s footsteps,

During Eisenhower’s reign
my grandfather retired and mowed his lawn
until I took over. He primed the filter,
set the choke, then we took turns pulling
till the sputtering engine caught.
(“Somanabitch,” he spit)
And watched me as I mowed
back and forth for two dollars.

Once in the garage he showed me a scythe.
He mowed hay in the old country, and the women

The factories today are mostly closed down,
or full of robots or far off in Asia.
Ford City lives through the mail:
compensation, a thin pension,
and, of course, Social Security.

I always drive along the factory, windows rolled down;
I want my kids in the back seat to see.
Seven or eight, probably pensioners, congregate
on the corner, each man dressed quite alike:
Sears jacket, cigarette, salt-and-pepper hair.

“Honk the horn,” my oldest begs.
He waves and waves zealously

Without how small, within how strangely vast!
What stars of terror had their path in thee!
What music of the heavens and the sea
Lived in a sigh or thundered on the blast!
Here swept the gleam and pageant of the Past,
As Beauty trembled to her fate’s decree;
Here swords were forged for armies yet to be,
And tears were found too dreadful not to last.

Here stood the seats of judgment and its light,
To whose assizes all our dreams were led—
Our best and worst, our Paradise and Hell;
And in this room delivered now to night,
The mortal put its question to the dead,
And worlds were weighed, and God’s deep shadow fell.

Here an immortal river had its rise,
Though dusty now the fountain whence it ran
So swift and beautiful with good to man.
Here the foundation of an empire lies—
The ruins of a realm seen not with eyes,
That now the vision of a gnat could scan.
Here wars were fought within a little span,
Whose echoes yet resound on human skies.

Spilt here her wildest iris, still thine own,

stairways rise out of sight, and somewhere else

collapse, in-swallowed, devolving through walls or domes.
The same way Bach’s motive splays out to the right,
swoons flatly, swans it, footnotes, follows up,
talks to itself, purls, mutters, dawdles, resumes ...

Six is playing at infancy, one three five,
that’s all Baby knows, a block pile clumsily building.
Then the tall chord falls sideways—pretends
it’s a melody—everyone knows it’s a chord—

or a problem in long division which at one point just sticks
on that endless, that déjà vu decimal, six six six ...

ELEVEN

Eleven is caterpillars, two, marching: the one
stave of thick-barred sixteenth notes set down
precisely beneath the other, tiptoe to toetip,
close-clinging, rising and falling and mirrored:

one looks down and locks the other’s horns,
or its own; the two could be said to be linked
like the locked yet endlessly out-spiraling
spindled ribbons of DNA. Yet there’s something

scary, like Cicero’s dizzying concept
of motus animi, hurtling mind unstoppably inventing
figures on figures, yet with no vanishing point,
a world of ladders or stairwells

where space keeps revolving, welling up into space
endless, unfree, unfolding like stairs in a case.

So it has come to this – insomnia at 3:15 A.M., the clock tolling its engine   like a frog following a sundial yet having an electric seizure at the quarter hour.   The business of words keeps me awake. I am drinking cocoa, the warm brown mama.   I would like a simple life yet all night I am laying poems away in a long box.   It is my immortality box, my lay-away plan, my coffin.   All night dark wings flopping in my heart. Each an ambition bird.   The bird wants to be dropped from a high place like Tallahatchie Bridge.   He wants to light a kitchen match and immolate himself.   He wants to fly into the hand of Michelangelo and come out painted on a ceiling.   He wants to pierce the hornet’s nest and come out with a long godhead.   He wants to take bread and wine and bring forth a man happily floating in the Caribbean.   He wants to be pressed out like a key so he can unlock the Magi.   He wants to take leave among strangers passing out bits of his heart like hors d’oeuvres.   He wants to die changing his clothes and bolt for the sun like a diamond.   He wants, I want. Dear God, wouldn’t it be good enough just to drink cocoa?   I must get a new bird and a new immortality box. There is folly enough inside this one.

So it has come to this –
insomnia at 3:15 A.M.,
the clock tolling its engine

like a frog following
a sundial yet having an electric
seizure at the quarter hour.

The business of words keeps me awake.
I am drinking cocoa,
the warm brown mama.

I would like a simple life
yet all night I am laying
poems away in a long box.

It is my immortality box,
my lay-away plan,
my coffin.

All night dark wings
flopping in my heart.
Each an ambition bird.

The bird wants to be dropped
from a high place like Tallahatchie Bridge.

He wants to light a kitchen match
and immolate himself.

He wants to fly into the hand of Michelangelo
and come out painted on a ceiling.

He wants to pierce the hornet’s nest
and come out with a long godhead.

He wants to take bread and wine
and bring forth a man happily floating in the Caribbean.

He wants to be pressed out like a key
so he can unlock the Magi.

He wants to take leave among strangers
passing out bits of his heart like hors d’oeuvres.

He wants to die changing his clothes
and bolt for the sun like a diamond.

He wants, I want.
Dear God, wouldn’t it be
good enough just to drink cocoa?

I must get a new bird
and a new immortality box.
There is folly enough inside this one.

Here, in this darkened room of this old house,      I sit beside the fire.     I hear again, Within, the scutter where the mice carouse,      Without, the gutter dropping with the rain. Opposite, are black shelves of wormy books,      To left, glazed cases, dusty with the same, Behind, a wall, with rusty guns on hooks,      To right, the fire, that chokes one panting flame. Over the mantel, black as funeral cloth,      A portrait hangs, a man, whose flesh the worm Has mawed this hundred years, whose clothes the moth      A century since, has channelled to a term. I cannot see his face :  I only know He stares at me, that man of long ago.   I light the candles in the long brass sticks,      I see him now, a pale-eyed, simpering man, Framed in carved wood, wherein the death-watch ticks,      A most dead face :  yet when the work began That face, the pale puce coat, the simpering smile,      The hands that hold a book, the eyes that gaze, Moved to the touch of mind a little while.      The painter sat in judgment on his ways : The painter turned him to and from the light,      Talked about art, or bade him lift his head. Judged the lips’ paleness and the temples’ white,      And now his work abides ;  the man is dead. But is he dead ?  This dusty study drear Creaks in its panels that the man is here.   Here, beyond doubt, he lived, in that old day.      “He was a Doctor here,” the student thought. Here, when the puce was new, that now is grey,      That simpering man his daily practice wrought. Here he let blood, prescribed the pill and drop,      The leech, the diet ;  here his verdict given Brought agonies of hoping to a stop,      Here his condemned confessioners were shriven. What is that book he holds, the key, too dim      To read, to know ;  some little book he wrote, Forgotten now, but still the key to him.      He sacrificed his vision for his coat. I see the man ;  a simpering mask that hid A seeing mind that simpering men forbid.   Those are his books no doubt, untoucht, undusted,      Unread, since last he left them on the shelves, Octavo sermons that the fox has rusted,      Sides splitting off from brown decaying twelves. This was his room, this darkness of old death,      This coffin-room with lights like embrasures, The place is poisonous with him ;  like a breath      On glass, he stains the spirit ;  he endures. Here is his name within the sermon book,      And verse, “When hungry Worms my Body eat” ; He leans across my shoulder as I look,      He who is God or pasture to the wheat. He who is Dead is still upon the soul      A check, an inhibition, a control.   I draw the bolts.     I am alone within.      The moonlight through the coloured glass comes faint, Mottling the passage wall like human skin,      Pale with the breathings left of withered paint. But others walk the empty house with me,      There is no loneliness within these walls No more than there is stillness in the sea      Or silence in the eternal waterfalls. There in the room, to right, they sit at feast ;      The dropping grey-beard with the cold blue eye, The lad, his son, that should have been a priest,      And he, the rake, who made his mother die. And he, the gambling man, who staked the throw, They look me through, they follow when I go.   They follow with still footing down the hall,      I know their souls, those fellow-tenants mine, Their shadows dim those colours on the wall,      They point my every gesture with a sign. That grey-beard cast his aged servant forth      After his forty years of service done, The gambler supped up riches as the north      Sups with his death the glories of the sun. The lad betrayed his trust ;  the rake was he      Who broke two women’s hearts to ease his own : They nudge each other as they look at me,      Shadows, all our, and yet as hard as stone. And there, he comes, that simpering man, who sold His mind for coat of puce and penny gold.   O ruinous house, within whose corridors      None but the wicked and the mad go free. (On the dark stairs they wait, behind the doors      They crouch, they watch, or creep to follow me.) Deep in old blood your ominous bricks are red,      Firm in old bones your walls’ foundations stand, With dead men’s passions built upon the dead,      With broken hearts for lime and oaths for sand. Terrible house, whose horror I have built,      Sin after sin, unseen, as sand that slips Telling the time, till now the heaped guilt      Cries, and the planets circle to eclipse. You only are the Daunter, you alone Clutch, till I feel your ivy on the bone.

Here, in this darkened room of this old house,
I sit beside the fire.     I hear again,
Within, the scutter where the mice carouse,
Without, the gutter dropping with the rain.
Opposite, are black shelves of wormy books,
To left, glazed cases, dusty with the same,
Behind, a wall, with rusty guns on hooks,
To right, the fire, that chokes one panting flame.
Over the mantel, black as funeral cloth,
A portrait hangs, a man, whose flesh the worm
Has mawed this hundred years, whose clothes the moth
A century since, has channelled to a term.
I cannot see his face :  I only know
He stares at me, that man of long ago.

I light the candles in the long brass sticks,
I see him now, a pale-eyed, simpering man,
Framed in carved wood, wherein the death-watch ticks,
A most dead face :  yet when the work began
That face, the pale puce coat, the simpering smile,
The hands that hold a book, the eyes that gaze,
Moved to the touch of mind a little while.
The painter sat in judgment on his ways :
The painter turned him to and from the light,
Talked about art, or bade him lift his head.
Judged the lips’ paleness and the temples’ white,
And now his work abides ;  the man is dead.
But is he dead ?  This dusty study drear
Creaks in its panels that the man is here.

Here, beyond doubt, he lived, in that old day.
“He was a Doctor here,” the student thought.
Here, when the puce was new, that now is grey,
That simpering man his daily practice wrought.
Here he let blood, prescribed the pill and drop,
The leech, the diet ;  here his verdict given
Brought agonies of hoping to a stop,
Here his condemned confessioners were shriven.
What is that book he holds, the key, too dim
To read, to know ;  some little book he wrote,
Forgotten now, but still the key to him.
He sacrificed his vision for his coat.
I see the man ;  a simpering mask that hid
A seeing mind that simpering men forbid.

Those are his books no doubt, untoucht, undusted,
Unread, since last he left them on the shelves,
Octavo sermons that the fox has rusted,
Sides splitting off from brown decaying twelves.
This was his room, this darkness of old death,
This coffin-room with lights like embrasures,
The place is poisonous with him ;  like a breath
On glass, he stains the spirit ;  he endures.
Here is his name within the sermon book,
And verse, “When hungry Worms my Body eat” ;
He leans across my shoulder as I look,
He who is God or pasture to the wheat.
He who is Dead is still upon the soul
A check, an inhibition, a control.

I draw the bolts.     I am alone within.
The moonlight through the coloured glass comes faint,
Mottling the passage wall like human skin,
Pale with the breathings left of withered paint.
But others walk the empty house with me,
There is no loneliness within these walls
No more than there is stillness in the sea
Or silence in the eternal waterfalls.
There in the room, to right, they sit at feast ;
The dropping grey-beard with the cold blue eye,
The lad, his son, that should have been a priest,
And he, the rake, who made his mother die.
And he, the gambling man, who staked the throw,
They look me through, they follow when I go.

They follow with still footing down the hall,
I know their souls, those fellow-tenants mine,
Their shadows dim those colours on the wall,
They point my every gesture with a sign.
That grey-beard cast his aged servant forth
After his forty years of service done,
The gambler supped up riches as the north
Sups with his death the glories of the sun.
The lad betrayed his trust ;  the rake was he
Who broke two women’s hearts to ease his own :
They nudge each other as they look at me,
Shadows, all our, and yet as hard as stone.
And there, he comes, that simpering man, who sold
His mind for coat of puce and penny gold.

O ruinous house, within whose corridors
None but the wicked and the mad go free.
(On the dark stairs they wait, behind the doors
They crouch, they watch, or creep to follow me.)
Deep in old blood your ominous bricks are red,
Firm in old bones your walls’ foundations stand,
With dead men’s passions built upon the dead,
With broken hearts for lime and oaths for sand.
Terrible house, whose horror I have built,
Sin after sin, unseen, as sand that slips
Telling the time, till now the heaped guilt
Cries, and the planets circle to eclipse.
You only are the Daunter, you alone
Clutch, till I feel your ivy on the bone.

In which I try to decipher
the story it tells,
this syntax of monuments
flanking the old courthouse:
here, a rough outline
like the torso of a woman
great with child—
a steatite boulder from which
the Indians girdled the core
to make of it a bowl,
and left in the stone a wound; here,

the bronze figure of Thomas Jefferson,
quill in hand, inscribing
a language of freedom,
a creation story—
his hand poised at the word
happiness. There is not yet an ending,
no period—the single mark,
intended or misprinted, that changes
the meaning of everything.

Here too, for the Confederacy,
an obelisk, oblivious
in its name—a word
that also meant the symbol
to denote, in ancient manuscripts,
the spurious, corrupt, or doubtful;
at its base, forged
in concrete, a narrative
of valor, virtue, states' rights.

Here, it is only the history of a word,
obelisk,
that points us toward
what's not there; all of it
palimpsest, each mute object
repeating a single refrain:

Remember this.

we smiled and kept playing

all I have to offer is
make as many mistakes
as you can handle but make
them as soon as possible
oh and don’t waste time
following each other from
opposite sides of the river
when storm blows wig
off my head it simply
means it is time to let
the storm take its share

Will haul this gelatinous body, will lash forward this non-form, will push this organism of gas through the gray regions.
 
A sour wind tears through the thin white hair. A wind of vinegar and henbane tears in the rustling, discarded bird-shells that were abandoned empty and fragile when the throbbing bird-boils moved on toward so-called life. Now I see the cunning needle-trees sling these clumps of heavy pouch-flesh back and forth between them: small feather-birds “fly” above my heads.
 
I haul myself, I haul myself, I haul my dragging structure along the river furrow’s muddy, sloppily overlapping slopes. I am so bitter, so wet, so the mouth smears the inside with the sweetness of the chewed-up blood-chisel. Out of this blood I am going to suck my nourishment for some time.
 
I haul, I urge my dissolved substance, slowly forward across the metal of calm stones, the hovering thread-glue’s suction toward a point in the distant middle of the perspective. Where the river’s banks will meet and like the thinnest needle of silver of liquid will drill its dark tunnel-water straight into the heart of the dying image, this moistly broken-up surface of paper to which we cling.
 
I haul I haul I touch myself, touch the skin-rind with chafed-up viscous fingers. Little mermaid from ocean foam molded–I haul my long veils, layers of elastic cartilage, of slippery, shimmering membranes, chlorophyll. The gills shudder and glow deep down in this chasm of tissue–constantly rustling, squeaking, gasping for air. This whirling, howling, desperate lack of oxygen; the scream–if it had had enough oxygen to scream and a mouth with which to scream–the scream to swallow the entire lung full of clear wind.
 
Lizards play, glitter green, blue, and red between the skin membranes of the body dress. Where does this mass end? I search inward through strata to find the core of my plasma wet from juices, to find the core of body-flesh despite the outer, surrounding flesh, the naked body’s stable surface, a kind of human here inside the bluing, plant-becoming. Something to hold on to behind the spread of the sickness of mud, fermentation. But there is nothing to grasp beneath this mantle of slippery webbed skin, burst through by a pounding net of veins.
 
I now lick my tongue against the outer claws of the fingers to tear life into the ions, to make sores bitter in the tongue’s blue ventricles. A kind of pain therefore radiates against the inner glands, a faint spasm of cheers before this, the nervous system’s last chance to communicate with the dying I. The mists smart, shimmer, the lumps of blue cobalt from the mustard gas corrode through the otherwise red shroud-clouds that drag their bellies against the river’s surface. In one of the skin-folds between the pockets of the genital dress, lizards gather in heaps of glimmering scales.
 
But time runs on time and starvation and the weakness carries me in across the gray regions. And the soul’s dark night will slowly be lowered through me. That is why I now slowly fold myself like a muscle against the wet clay to press the flesh against the sleep-gland’s mouths. I will sleep now in my bird body in the down, and a bitter star will radiate eternally above the glowing face’s watercourse.

Yet I'm the one who dreamt our basic dream
In the Old World while still a serf of kings,
Who dreamt a dream so strong, so brave, so true,
That even yet its mighty daring sings
In every brick and stone, in every furrow turned
That's made America the land it has become.
O, I'm the man who sailed those early seas
In search of what I meant to be my home—
For I'm the one who left dark Ireland's shore,
And Poland's plain, and England's grassy lea,
And torn from Black Africa's strand I came
To build a ""homeland of the free.""

The free?

Who said the free?  Not me?
Surely not me?  The millions on relief today?
The millions shot down when we strike?
The millions who have nothing for our pay?
For all the dreams we've dreamed
And all the songs we've sung
And all the hopes we've held
And all the flags we've hung,
The millions who have nothing for our pay—
Except the dream that's almost dead today.

O, let America be America again—
The land that never has been yet—
And yet must be—the land where every man is free.
The land that's mine—the poor man's, Indian's, Negro's, ME—
Who made America,
Whose sweat and blood, whose faith and pain,
Whose hand at the foundry, whose plow in the rain,
Must bring back our mighty dream again.

Sure, call me any ugly name you choose—
The steel of freedom does not stain.
From those who live like leeches on the people's lives,
We must take back our land again,
America!

O, yes,
I say it plain,
America never was America to me,
And yet I swear this oath—
America will be!

Out of the rack and ruin of our gangster death,
The rape and rot of graft, and stealth, and lies,
We, the people, must redeem
The land, the mines, the plants, the rivers.

Acts of love have material effects. For a woman tending the sacred fire, these include the risk of becoming an extinguisher of flames essential to civic life. It is a burden to put out what others hold as central to faith in coherence. Acts of faith have material effects — a Vestal Virgin touched by encounter must be buried alive, a beautiful metaphor for shame itself, which squirms even under all that dirt. Thus, the dead learn too late that devotion should be unidirectional, a straight line from here to suffocation. Love must not bleed at the edges, must not meet others in the banal spaces of civic life. It is a burden to personify. If Vesta’s hearth is the site of the sacred, its material effects are destruction: burning, consumption, constant hunger for more wood. Acts of destruction have fantasmatic effects. For a body surviving encounter, these include civic life, shame; the risk of being a proxy — tender of the hearth belonging to the public, by way of the goddess, who embodies a dream of faith in coherence. Material effects extinguish themselves, eventually, as when a woman touched in the correct way undoes the burden of love and puts out, taking the goddamn city in and under.

I  Self-Portrait A house with three stories. In the basement, monsters. The upper floors were empty. No furniture, nothing. I had a magic pebble that I needed to hide. But where? Woke in a room with the bed breathing. Each day the same scandal—this body. These teeth and hands.           2  The Miniature Bed A miniature bed, and in it two tiny people not sleeping, not able to sleep because a small lie has flowered between them, fragile as a new, white crocus. The miniature bed holds them like a miniature boat making its slow, true course to morning. These tiny people, thoughts thrumming like mice, are quiet as the lie blooms over them in the night, fanning its moth petals, becoming to them like a moon hovering over their bed, a moon they might almost touch with their miniature hands, if they weren't certain that one wrong gesture might break the spindles of their small world, if their hearts were not drops of trembling quicksilver, if they were brave, if they could see that small is no smaller than big, that thimbles are deep as oceans for any god, they might even touch each other then, opening the dark, like a match, the sun's flaring.      3  Harvest   The fields are a book of uses. Near the house a combine takes the corn down in long rows. Dust rises up and replaces itself. A quick net of starlings drops to the furrows and sunshine pours like polished grain onto the feeding earth, this country.   In the kitchen, milk streams from the gallon thin and fresh as luck. We flourish. All around us, things flourish. Cows strain the fence with their abundance. The herd makes a sound like swelling.   Out in the cut field birds clean the fallen cobs into sets of teeth.      4  Sonnet for Lost Teeth   The combines were tearing off the field’s clothes. It was August, haying season. My tooth was loose, a snag in the clam of my mouth. I worked it like a pearl. I'd been out of school for sixty days. In the sweat of the barn I watched him shoot the calf in the head. He wiped the hide gently, like cleaning his glasses. Overnight, I grew a beard so I wouldn't have to get married. I let my feet go black from burned grasses. It never gets easier he said, kicking straw over the blood patch. She went down so quiet it was almost sad.

I  Self-Portrait

A house
with three stories.
In the basement, monsters.
The upper floors were empty.
No furniture, nothing.
I had a magic pebble
that I needed to hide.
But where?
Woke in a room
with the bed breathing.
Each day the same
scandal—this body.
These teeth and hands.





2  The Miniature Bed

A miniature bed, and in it two tiny people
not sleeping, not able to sleep because
a small lie has flowered between them,
fragile as a new, white crocus.
The miniature bed holds them like a miniature boat
making its slow, true course to morning.
These tiny people, thoughts thrumming like mice,
are quiet as the lie blooms over them
in the night, fanning its moth petals,
becoming to them like a moon hovering
over their bed, a moon they might almost touch
with their miniature hands, if they weren't certain
that one wrong gesture might break
the spindles of their small world, if their hearts
were not drops of trembling quicksilver,
if they were brave, if they could see
that small is no smaller than big, that thimbles
are deep as oceans for any god, they might even
touch each other then, opening the dark,
like a match, the sun's flaring.
3  Harvest

The fields are a book of uses.
Near the house
a combine takes the corn down
in long rows.
Dust rises up and replaces itself.
A quick net of starlings
drops to the furrows
and sunshine pours like polished grain
onto the feeding earth,
this country.

In the kitchen, milk streams
from the gallon
thin and fresh as luck.
We flourish.
All around us, things flourish.
Cows strain the fence with their abundance.
The herd makes a sound like swelling.

Out in the cut field
birds clean the fallen cobs
into sets of teeth.
4  Sonnet for Lost Teeth

The combines were tearing off the field’s clothes.
It was August, haying season. My tooth
was loose, a snag in the clam of my mouth.
I worked it like a pearl. I'd been out of school
for sixty days. In the sweat of the barn
I watched him shoot the calf in the head.
He wiped the hide gently, like cleaning his glasses.
Overnight, I grew a beard so I wouldn't
have to get married. I let my feet go black
from burned grasses. It never gets easier
he said, kicking straw over the blood patch.
She went down so quiet it was almost
sad. Later, when my tooth fell out, I buried it
under my pillow and it grew into money.
5  Talisman

Waiting for the school bus you find
the femur of a baby animal
on the ground. You carry
that femur in your pocket
the entire morning and touch it
secretly through the cloth.
When the teacher asks
a question you don't raise
your hand but quietly
wrap your fingers around
the thin shape, that bone
without a mother.
6  On Waking

Half of everything is invisible.
A river drifts below the river.
A gesture lost in the body.
Wind moves through the open
windows of the trees.

Beyond the day, another day.

Dreamed I was drowning
my mother's silk laundry
in the river,
kneeling on the wet rocks.
Back and forth I drowned it
in the gray clouds...
7  Eros

Each year fish run the green vein of the river.
The bones of skunks lie buried in the riverbank
upside down, waiting for rain.

From a fragment of a Greek statue
you can tell the posture of the whole god.
A skeleton has the same intelligence.

So that when a girl discovers it,
loosened by summer rain, surfaced
like a white instrument in the grass,
she suddenly knows how to take it up
and shake the strange rhythms from it like castanets.
8  A Childhood

The horse had been beaten and flies
crawled excited on the beat marks.
He held still in the sunblazed pasture.
For a few minutes I stood at the wire fence.
He was aware of me, but he did not turn—
except his eye, slightly. He listened
through the many ears of the grasses.
A jay made a hole in the air with its cry.
Everywhere, invisible as heat, the gods
married each other and went to war.
The excitement of it vibrated in the flies.
As if we both were standing still
inside some greater, more violent motion.

By Matthea Harvey
By Matthea Harvey
The Inside Out Mermaid is fine with letting it all hang out–veins, muscles, the bits of fat at her belly, her small gray spleen. At first her lover loves it–with her organs on the outside, she's the ultimate open book. He can pump her lungs like two bellows and make her gasp; ask her difficult questions and study the synapses firing in her brain as she answers to see if she's lying; poke a pleasure center in the frontal lobe and watch her squirm. No need for bouquets or sad stories about his childhood. He just plucks a pulmonary vein and watches the left ventricle flounder. But before long, she starts to sense that her lover, like all the others before him, is getting restless. This is when she starts showing them her collections–the basket of keys from all over the world, the box of zippers with teeth of every imaginable size–all chosen to convey a sense of openness. As a last resort, she’ll even read out loud the entries from her diary about him to him. But eventually he’ll become convinced she’s hiding things from him and she is. Her perfect skin. Her long black hair. Her red mouth, never chapped from exposure to sun or wind, how she secretly loves that he can’t touch her here or here.

By Matthea Harvey
By Matthea Harvey
When my hole-punch drizzles tiny paper circles onto the carpet, my wolf sister moans and bites it, covering her ears with her paws. I think she’s tired of the moon. She takes a stack of dinner plates from my cupboard and slinks off to the park to break them. Our brother shows up a week later, collapses on the sofa like a fur throw. Why have they come here when everything I do is wrong? They howl in the shower together but the water doesn’t mask the sound. I go in afterwards with paper towels to mop the droplets–I know there’ll be water all over–but the room is bone dry. Maybe this time things will be different. I hide the home movies in case they ask for them. In the one I always watch, there’s some wobbly footage of the sky, then my father lowers the camera’s eye to mother teaching my sister and brother to “tell time.” They’re following a mother hare on her sunset rounds–one leveret mouthful at 12 o’clock, another at 3, 6, 9. Then the camera zooms in on me–I’ve spat out my pacifier made of fur and I’m on the porch surrounded by bonsai trees, killing or saving Barbie.

We were made to understand it would be Terrible. Every small want, every niggling urge, Every hate swollen to a kind of epic wind.    Livid, the land, and ravaged, like a rageful  Dream. The worst in us having taken over  And broken the rest utterly down.                                                                     A long age  Passed. When at last we knew how little  Would survive us—how little we had mended    Or built that was not now lost—something  Large and old awoke. And then our singing  Brought on a different manner of weather.    Then animals long believed gone crept down  From trees. We took new stock of one another.  We wept to be reminded of such color.

Everything has gender
in Arabic.
History is male.
Fiction is female.
Dream is male.
Wish is female.

Feminine words are followed
by a circle with two dots over.
They call it the tied circle,
knotted with wishes
which come true only when forgotten
or replaced by the wishes of others.

In the town of tied wishes,
people feel great anticipation
because a stranger will arrive
today in her feminine sign.
Someone says he saw her
two dots glittering,
refuting another’s vision
of a cat’s eyes hunting in darkness.
So scary, he says, how the moon
hides in her red circle.

Everyone is busy today
listing wishes on pieces
of paper they’ll give to the wind.
When the stranger finds them
on her way, she’ll collect them
and garland them to her circle,
tossing some old wishes
to make space for the new.
They say the dropped ones
will come true.

The stranger’s lateness
worries the waiting.
Someone says she’s searching
for a word to complete
a special sentence,
the gift she’ll bring to town.

Another wonders if she seeks
a verb or a noun,
offering to find her.
A third warns that the stranger
may turn him into a flower
with one touch, blooming
for only a moment,
before a withering death,
and her circle throbs with songs
causing sadness and elation,
and something so obscure
no one has a name for it.
Will she complete a verb
or a noun phrase — or give a solo,
a word complete on its own?
They wonder.

When they finally hear footsteps,
they know the stranger must be near.
Make sure the gate is open,
they remind one another.
They hear clinking —

your lean, spare life. Bend your curves in a knot. Brother, smudge your
saw-tooth edges.

Third:      Cut red seaweed to conceal your gray cadaver;
start wetting your skin down; after scraping,
drip your bowels of blood, change into wolf.

Fourth:    The savannah sparrow flies north.
In speech, smell fine-grained hawthorn.
Collapse your voice into bark and howl.

There once lived a great king whose twin wives could bear him no children. A wandering sage saw the king’s grief and offered him a magical mango. She who ate the mango would be with child. As he had two wives, the king cut the mango into two perfect halves and offered one half to each wife. After nine months, each wife gave birth to one lifeless half. Horrified, the king ordered these clots of flesh to be left in the forest. A wandering demon found the two lifeless halves and cupped one in each palm. When she brought them together, the two halves fused and a whole child was made in front of her eyes—the demon named the child Jarasandha.
Years passed by and this child grew to be an intimidating and invincible warrior. In a fight with Bhim, an equally invincible warrior, Jarasandha was ripped in half by his enemy. But, each time he was ripped apart, his halves found a way to meet up and become whole. Krishna, who witnessed how Jarasandha’s flesh found its own way back to flesh, motioned to his own cousin with his fingers: toss the halves of his body in opposite directions, he
suggested.
So, when Bhim ripped Jarasandha apart once again, he swung his left half to the right side of the arena and his right half to the left. And his body found no way to return to itself.
In the Toronto airport, where I’ve arrived for a conference, I watch an older Punjabi lady—made to sit in a wheelchair behind two lines of customs officials, a security guard, a translator, and a service-staff member—scream that her son is outside the airport may she please just go tell him she is here she is here she is here please. I stand there holding her hand, my own luggage reluctantly traveling in loops on the belt. Beta—child— she says to me: please tell them my son is here and I am here what is the problem let me go let me go to him.

Something in altitude kindles power-thirst Mere horse-height suffices the emir Bestowing from rich folds of prodigious turban Upon crawling peasants in the dust Rare imperceptible nods enwrapped In princely boredom.   I too have known A parching of that primordial palate, A quickening to manifest life Of a long recessive appetite. Though strapped and manacled That day I commanded from the pinnacle Of a three-tiered world a bridge befitting The proud deranged deity I had become. A magic rug of rushing clouds Billowed and rubbed its white softness Like practiced houri fingers on my sole And through filters of its gauzy fabric Revealed wonders of a metropolis Magic-struck to fairyland proportions. By different adjustments of vision I caused the clouds to float Over a stilled landscape, over towers And masts and smoke-plumed chimneys; Or turned the very earth, unleashed From itself, a roaming fugitive Beneath a constant sky. Then came A sudden brightness over the world, A rare winter’s smile it was, and printed On my cloud carpet a black cross Set in an orb of rainbows. To which Splendid nativity came–who else would come But gray unsporting Reason, faithless Pedant offering a bald refractory annunciation? But oh what beauty! What speed! A chariot of night in panic flight From Our Royal Proclamation of the rites Of day! And riding out Our procession Of fantasy We slaked an ancient Vestigial greed shriveled by ages of dormancy Till the eyes exhausted by glorious pageantries Returned to rest on that puny Legend of the life jacket stowed away Of all places under my seat.   Now I think I know why gods Are so partial to heights—to mountain Tops and spires, to proud iroko trees And thorn-guarded holy bombax, Why petty household divinities Will sooner perch on a rude board Strung precariously from brittle rafters Of a thatched roof than sit squarely On safe earth.

Something in altitude kindles power-thirst
Mere horse-height suffices the emir
Bestowing from rich folds of prodigious turban
Upon crawling peasants in the dust
Rare imperceptible nods enwrapped
In princely boredom.

I too have known
A parching of that primordial palate,
A quickening to manifest life
Of a long recessive appetite.
Though strapped and manacled
That day I commanded from the pinnacle
Of a three-tiered world a bridge befitting
The proud deranged deity I had become.
A magic rug of rushing clouds
Billowed and rubbed its white softness
Like practiced houri fingers on my sole
And through filters of its gauzy fabric
Revealed wonders of a metropolis
Magic-struck to fairyland proportions.
By different adjustments of vision
I caused the clouds to float
Over a stilled landscape, over towers
And masts and smoke-plumed chimneys;
Or turned the very earth, unleashed
From itself, a roaming fugitive
Beneath a constant sky. Then came
A sudden brightness over the world,
A rare winter’s smile it was, and printed
On my cloud carpet a black cross
Set in an orb of rainbows. To which
Splendid nativity came–who else would come
But gray unsporting Reason, faithless
Pedant offering a bald refractory annunciation?
But oh what beauty! What speed!
A chariot of night in panic flight
From Our Royal Proclamation of the rites
Of day! And riding out Our procession
Of fantasy We slaked an ancient
Vestigial greed shriveled by ages of dormancy
Till the eyes exhausted by glorious pageantries
Returned to rest on that puny
Legend of the life jacket stowed away
Of all places under my seat.

Now I think I know why gods
Are so partial to heights—to mountain
Tops and spires, to proud iroko trees
And thorn-guarded holy bombax,
Why petty household divinities
Will sooner perch on a rude board
Strung precariously from brittle rafters
Of a thatched roof than sit squarely
On safe earth.

Citizen of Rome, you are the center of the universe. Problem is, circumference is—take a guess—me.   “Some things are impatient to be born While others are impatient to die.” Don’t say   I did not warn you. Next time they swear Shit happens, pop them square in the nose.   This will not help anybody, but helping is The farthest thing from my imperial mind.   If you keep your spirit blameless and pure People will drape you with laurels but   No one will have sex with you in backseats Or marble mausoleums or anywhere else,   A small price to pay for honor and respect Though not for me, being an emperor with no clothes.   Just pretend today is the last day of your life And act accordingly—not that such strictures   Apply to Yours Truly, sports fans. The forces of evil march on the fortress   Of your self. I wish I could explain why. But what if evil did not exist and what if   Your self was no fortress, see what I mean? Stoics get a bad name. Not in touch with feelings.  Too rigid. Know-it-all cocksure mothers. So the Stoics retain PR firms, don’t tell a soul.   If you really knew what was good for you, And you do, why do you care I’ll flail you alive?   True, pissing off your emperor is a poor plan, Even one like me mounted bare-assed on a steed.   Once upon a time, children…The story peters out. Circus revels and gladiatorial raves—   Seen one, seem them all. Life is tiresome, When will it end and will we ever notice?   I wish I knew. Really, I wish I cared. My pal, Marcus Aurelius, natters day and night:   “Living is more like wrestling than dancing.” Guess he never saw me take Molly at the club.   And he says we always have the option of Having no opinion. Right. Like he knows.   OK, then, where did I put my pants?

Perhaps you know what's there
By way of fear, for while

Living in pursuit of
And going always forth
Toward something that trembles.
Its knowledge is your mind.

What do you think about
The great ocean's sullen
Aristocrats—these small
Headaches and dark affairs

That bathe themselves in your
Staging grounds, where you go
To contemplate how what
You want became your mind?

The black oblivion
Offers no reprieve for
You, hunter—in its keep
Your ears have grown too sharp,

So sharp you almost hear
Your own heartbeat over
The subtle whispers of
Water’s dismal gardens.

Everything about you
Is overblown, even
Your mouth is uniquely
Talented at its tasks,

Gathering for slaughter
Animals in their sleep,
Speaking without a sound.
Noah had seven laws,

You have only one—eat
To build life out of death,
Survive above all things.
The fatalistic moon

Filtered down upon you
Seems an imitation
Of lives you will not live.
Would you be its hero?

Would you call out against
The morning’s weaving light
That shames the night before
The passing of its cool?

Would you be at the beach
When the invisible
Becomes a glow, to surprise?
Inland, workers dreaming

Of unitarian
Proposals lose no sleep
To fear about your mouth.
It is their wayward friends,

Who wandered too far west
Into fevered chaos,
That wake up with your name
As screams exploding dreams.

The inland ether holds
Clouds in your dismal shape.
Lucky are those who know
Nothing, who cannot see

Hell outlined in vapor.
Somewhere a piano
Plays a sorrowful song
Half-written by the hate

That a grieving loved one
Would stick into your heart.
Such are the arts of men.
Beware. Your time is near.

1. Here I rest, in South Georgia. A few feet of evolution away lie the graves of whale hunters, pointing north. A white fence shields them from elephant seals and their apocalyptic screams that each day warn of the end of the world, or maybe the beginning. . .   I survived five expeditions to the Pole. The one before last, “Imperial Trans-Antarctica,” nearly killed me. For two years I put up with the ice—no man can reap or sow        these fields. And, unlike farmers, I didn’t even need to ask God for rain, because ice is sated and more desolate than the Sahara.   I survived distance. Wrote one message after another beginning with a capital letter and a ""PS."" at the end. My own personal post office under my pillow closed for two years already, on holiday.   I survived six month-long polar days and nights; to this day, I don't know which one was worse.   My epitaph is simple. Carved in granite:                          FRANK WILD                          18 April 1873                          19 August 1939                          “Shackleton’s                           Right Hand Man” From those cast away here by a defect in the engine of the ship or nostalgia of the womb.   2. Ah yes. . . in the beginning was the ship. The ship stuck in ice.       Endurance.  Ships are women. They prefer soft seas. In the best-case scenario, she’s called La Santa Maria  and she throws you, like Columbus, on some foreign shore.   But if you get too close to her. . .   The very day after we washed her deck with warm water and soap, warmed her arteries with gin, stroked her lower back with our surrogate songs, shaved our beards and exposed the illiterate lines on our faces, she took off.   And from the shore, we saw how she broke her ribs, sinking, aft first, so fast we didn’t even have time to pray, leaving behind her ash-tree fragrance and faux pearls on the water.   “Such a woman!” someone laughed bitterly, “She knows when to leave so as not to be forgotten.”   3. A woman, naturally, has no business there. Antarctica is a masculine continent— male penguins keep the eggs warm, the moon stands up on the street to urinate after being kicked out of the tavern, the cold like a cut-throat razor, dulled for three thousand years, and the sled dogs, the Huskies, we kill with a single bullet so they won’t starve to death. In this way we instill a little character into the new land before the arrival of Conquistadors, thieves, assassins, missionaries, prostitutes, the first invading army of every continent.   Antarctica is a man’s continent, because only a man chooses to break into the darkness of the mind by conquering the body, as Amundsen and Scott did, their glory reaching to the apex of ecstasy. Zero degree of geographical latitude, utter collapse.   4. Hunger is overestimated. The stomach functions much like the      brain: when it has nothing to think about, it feeds off memories. It can last three days just thinking of a single biscuit. But those who have a better memory, meaning a much stronger      acidity, can go on for months remembering a slice of prosciutto, two fried eggs, sweetly folding their eyelids like napkins after a meal.   Then hallucinations begin. Banquets. Easter supper. Feet move impatiently under the table; the scent of rosemary wafts from a platter and two clean serving hands with burns here and there. That's when you feel grief-stricken and you attack the seals and penguins with your alpine knives and shoes like a madman in an empty amphitheater. Or is this, too, a hallucination, and in this case not ours but Antarctica's?   And when clarity finally returns, both stomach and brain notice only their own deep wrinkles.     5. Blubber, blubber, seal's blubber. Blubber that keeps your spirits alive, rendering it for fuel, for light, blubber to mask the body's foul odor, —a mixture of doubt, hope, and ammonia. And if you have nothing better to do, think of a cow's thigh hanging at the butcher's, its delicate streak of fat like a silk ribbon.   I survived even this sarcasm.   And every night, before bed, we read recipes to each other one of a few things we secretly rescued from the ship before she sank, as if these items were her lingerie.   What a show it was! What pathos in pronouncing prosciutto, sugar, omelet! What sensuality in milk, parsley, cinnamon! We made these words up ourselves. Nothing exists until its moment of absence.   But first, in order to warm up our mouths like actors before going on stage, we'd repeat mechanically, palates dry, ""Bless us, O Lord, and this food we've received through your mercy.”     6. It was the Romans who spoiled the word studying rhetoric before anatomy and mathematics:Vir bonus dicendi peritus “The good man skilled in speaking"" (Marcus Porcius Cato)   But in Antarctica, words are measured differently: by calories! With a simple greeting you lose five calories, just as many to keep a fire burning for a full minute. And a Ciceronian argument can consume a whole day’s       nutrition; think carefully before you open your mouth.   The word is overestimated.   Sometimes it’s enough to avert your eyes from your shoes to imply “gangrene”; and a vague exchange of glances between men is enough to understand that the ice is cracking beneath your feet and death is closer than your fingers.   7. Stretched smooth from end to end—such is Antarctica. In fact, even a baby’s skin looks withered by comparison.   No emotions. No regrets. No warnings. Either fight or die.   My father was like this more or less. A teacher at a village school. In classrooms that smelled of sheep-wool pullovers drying on the body. And eyes that moved freely in their hollows, like toes inside an older sibling’s shoes.   Unlike the Romans, my father preached about justice and honor his hands folded behind his back. His shoulders seemed twice as wide as his worn jacket.   I inherited his sharp, gray gaze and his soft voice. Eyes that say “Go” and a voice that says “Stay.” You never know which one to trust.     8. And mother? Oh, she was simply Captain Cook’s niece, —the great James Cook— from morning to night when she washed, swept, dug potatoes from the garden, fixed her husband’s tie on Sundays even from her bed, while in labor. She never spoke of this. As it wasn’t necessary. People speak of what they have, not what they are.   She was a tailor. Measured everyone's perimeter with a glance; erred only on the width of one’s neck, an unknown strength. Her large scissors followed the white chalk line on the cloth so precisely. ""Snip!"" She said little. Her silence followed the white outlines of another tailor, over a fabric much older than she was.   But now that I think of it, how did the poor woman respond to her friends asking, ""Where is your son?"" ""He's exploring the world."" ""And what does he bring back from there?"" ""Himself, alive, I hope."" ""What's the point of returning empty-handed after two years?”   Was she at least a little proud of me? Of her Frank? Certainly not. She was Captain Cook's niece. The past always conquers.     9. I was the first of thirteen children. And as a rule, each of them eyed one of my belongings. One eyed my bed near the window that overlooked the water where frogs lived and asparagus grew on the shore. Another eyed my green jacket bought with borrowed money, poker cards, a fishing net, my wicker chair with the damaged back. Another whistled my favorite tune: ""What Will We Do with a Drunken Sailor?” without reaching the refrain. And yet another envied the basement —that place I occupied in my father’s heart—  with its elm door hanging by a single hinge.   But the time hasn't come to leave home just yet, until your own brother begins to use your shaving kit and dreams of the same girl.     10. What shaving kit? Antarctica makes you grow a double-beard as if you were a hundred-year-old grave. And, while you remember wasting time waiting in line at       barber's another beard grows, a red one.   Here, each body part works for itself: the stomach, hands, intestines, eyes. . . The unity of the body is overestimated, too.   Only skin pulls everything together like a sled. The skin? Which skin? Man loses his first skin to his first love, like the snake early in spring on a thorn-apple bush that blocks the way. From that point on he stops counting the rest.   11.  I don’t know why it was named “Elephant Island,” when it answered the ocean with the cries of a she-wolf. We could only make out her sly teats under her belly. After       some time, if she didn’t kill us first, we’d begin to cry like wolves ourselves.   Twenty-two people. Packed next to one another under two       inverted boats like notes in Bach’s “Come, Sweet Death, Come Blessed Rest,” with more pauses, a dramatic suffocation between breaths. A dry, calcic cough was a sign of life. Or the delirious mutterings         of someone dreaming aloud of “ice” in the middle of ice, after they had cut off his toes.   But the hardest moment arrives in the morning, when, with shut eyes and plugged nostrils, as if drinking your own urine you recycle the same lie for four months straight: “Men, pack up your stuff! The boss might arrive today!”   And they obeyed me. Packed carefully each day from the start, leaving nothing shap in the folds of their bags, nothing that would spoil the line between fact and fiction.   It was a time when routine grew more powerful than hope.     12. Fish in the ocean toyed with our citizenship. On the seventh mile, we left our medals behind, class ranks, along with the dogs, potatoes, and a camera. We made fire out of money and kept only a single metal coin each so that archaeologists might trace us more easily centuries later. On Elephant Island, we had to bid farewell even to tobacco, tobacco which reminded us of village alleyways and walks home after midnight.   Time glided above us without touching a single strand of our      hair— nonexistent, as if gliding above ancient cities, exposing the solemnity of our white bones and crickets on absent walls.   That’s when the ten commandments deserted us: “Do not steal,” “Do not lie,” “Do not covet,” “Honor your parents”. . . save one of them perhaps, the one about the holiness of Sunday.   We already had nothing. We belonged to no one. An entirely new species: HOMO ANTARCTICUS. A scientific proof that “forgotten” and “free” mean the same thing.     13. Two years after returning from the world of the dead, you find your house taken over by another tenant and the rent tripled, the commemorative plaque nailed to the gate: “Here lived F.W.” And your lover, or better, ex-lover, for the same reason, in the arms of another three times more handsome.   You see your own image sold at an auction. Artifact. Original. “Brrramp. Sold!” The price so high you can’t afford it. But even if you could, you're an illegal customer, holding a death certificate in your hand.   And you find your parents turned into winter trees their eyes fixed on a large cloud of plaster. They don’t expect visitors. Best not disturb them. Let their leaves fall quietly where they will let the crow's nest remain in the armpit of a branch, where it has always been.   Perhaps you should take a shortcut, start over. Or you know what? There’s a war going on nearby, they say. Go there instead! But this time die better.     14. War’s never satisfied with flesh; Fresh, branded, smoked, with or without blood blue blood, dark, thick, whatever kind. And frozen blood like yours could store at minus 40 degrees Celsius, viruses from 1914 unscathed, and the map of the old Empire          and Scott's hurt ego  and old coins minted with the head of Edward VII, and Browning’s poetry and the epic of the unknown, like an envelope inside an envelope, all making you the ideal candidate.   Back on the ship, ammunition everywhere, sailing through the cold Northern seas where you had to learn a new language. A new language is like a fish: first, you need to remove its spine in order to chew it.   Unlike in Antarctica, one’s purpose in war is clear: kill or be killed, though sometimes it’s the same difference.   Baltic nights gave you what Antarctica refused you: the other half of the celestial sphere. You meet Vera, the widow of a tea plantation owner, a character out of a Baroque novel, her pupils blurred with dusk, and the ritual of mourning fitted perfectly to her body like a final journey.      15. A man charmed by a glacier, who knows too well the flawless forms of her body, feels her eavesdropping gaze even when asleep, her clean and distant breath and her heart, a piece of ice, that melts inside a cigarette case heated for drinking water, finds it difficult to marry a real woman, to marry Vera. And Africa.   I bought land. Barren. Hundreds of acres. In Zululand. I didn’t fare well with tobacco. Planted cotton instead, chose bodily peace rather than meditation. My nearest neighbor lived 45 miles away. White, of course. And my fate, never blended with the blacks, those beautiful statues, wrapped in straw. I heard them nod off during lunch break, like the oars of a boat, in complete sync. They knew where they were heading. But I didn’t.   And I was right. It didn’t take long before drought, floods, worms destroyed everything. The bank left me only my own beard and the malarial shadow of a baobab. Apart from other things, Vera filled out divorce papers. The woman in the yellow dress, yellow as quinine, yellow as the sigh of a hinge at dusk, the woman married to the hero who now can’t even manage a small plot of land.     16. The man in front of me —my master I call ""Boss""— is newly shaved, and dressed in a striped tie and jacket as if the Prince of Wales or Fred Astaire, a style that arrives here two years late. He asks me to serve whiskey to clients at the bar and chat them up using their jargon, gestures, sentences uninterrupted by mosquitoes, and the abstract rhetoric of the Depression years. And, to be frank, he pays me for the latter.   But what do I know, what does a survivor know about the art of living, for which new instincts are needed, new muscles and other kinds of heart valves?   Furthermore, how can I obey such a spick-and-span boss, having known the smoky gods of Antarctica who recognize each other solely by the nose and can end rebellions with a glance and count the deaths as members of the crew? How can I take orders from a boss whose name isn't Shackleton?     17. ""Second in command,” “Lieutenant,” “Shackleton’s right hand”   What did she see so clearly in me, my drama teacher in elementary school when she'd always assign me the role of Father Joseph, of Gaspar the Magi offering Jesus frankincense, or of John the Baptist always there to clear the path? What did she see in my metallic pupils, baritone voice,       infrequent speech as if scissors, bandage, and iodine inside a first aid kit?   Under Antarctica's naked sky, each of us followed his own star. Even the carpenter, his own heraldic calling. You didn’t need much to feed them;  just a few crusts of insomnia and the tents' punctured holes.   My star was weak; you could hardly see it hidden behind another larger, troubled star like a calm valley that appears behind jagged peaks more attractive when absent.     18. What happened afterward can be told in a few words: I worked in a mine; earth’s warm heart, happened to be crueler than her frozen brain. I laid railroad tracks South, always toward the Unknown. It was like playing only two strings on a violin: joy and sorrow, fatefully blending at the horizon.   I repaired houses. Another waste of time. I never understood their weak points, just as you can't make out eyes from genitals or mouth in some underwater creatures.   And when I was left penniless, I gave lectures about Antarctica, water gurgling in my gullet every five words, for those few who listened patiently to an adventure of survival.   Then Bea arrived. Or sweet Beatrice. It was easy to grant her what I had left in my heart —that set of heavy museum keys— with no fear she might lose them.   Tired lungs and liver could barely follow my split image of bust and bottle of booze. Like a prophet in the last circle of Dante’s Inferno, I carried my own decapitated head in hand.   My ashes were lost at the base of a church. No one       thought of them. It was a time of war. Another world war. The second one not knowing what to do with her own ashes either.   19. Some of us died in the war.  Others took to the sea again, the gray, cracked waters of the South, decks perspiring fuel and alcohol. Our random itineraries. Full-time melancholics.   For months in Antarctica, we waited for our shadow to return and consumed that question you ask yourself only once in your      lifetime, the way one consumes chickenpox.   And the rest of the time, we counted the scars left on our faces, with a gesture you could call indifferent and epic, or childlike.
""The wild will keep calling and calling forever in your ears. You
cannot escape the 'little voices.'""

1. Here I rest, in South Georgia. A few feet of evolution away lie the graves of whale hunters, pointing north. A white fence shields them from elephant seals and their apocalyptic screams that each day warn of the end of the world, or maybe the beginning. . .   I survived five expeditions to the Pole. The one before last, “Imperial Trans-Antarctica,” nearly killed me. For two years I put up with the ice—no man can reap or sow        these fields. And, unlike farmers, I didn’t even need to ask God for rain, because ice is sated and more desolate than the Sahara.   I survived distance. Wrote one message after another beginning with a capital letter and a ""PS."" at the end. My own personal post office under my pillow closed for two years already, on holiday.   I survived six month-long polar days and nights; to this day, I don't know which one was worse.   My epitaph is simple. Carved in granite:                          FRANK WILD                          18 April 1873                          19 August 1939                          “Shackleton’s                           Right Hand Man” From those cast away here by a defect in the engine of the ship or nostalgia of the womb.   2. Ah yes. . . in the beginning was the ship.

The second one not knowing what to do with her own ashes either.   19. Some of us died in the war.  Others took to the sea again, the gray, cracked waters of the South, decks perspiring fuel and alcohol. Our random itineraries. Full-time melancholics.   For months in Antarctica, we waited for our shadow to return and consumed that question you ask yourself only once in your      lifetime, the way one consumes chickenpox.   And the rest of the time, we counted the scars left on our faces, with a gesture you could call indifferent and epic, or childlike.

1.
Here I rest, in South Georgia.
A few feet of evolution away
lie the graves of whale hunters, pointing north.
A white fence shields them from elephant seals
and their apocalyptic screams that each day warn
of the end of the world, or maybe the beginning. . .

I survived five expeditions to the Pole.
The one before last, “Imperial Trans-Antarctica,” nearly killed me.
For two years I put up with the ice—no man can reap or sow
these fields.
And, unlike farmers, I didn’t even need to ask God for rain,
because ice is sated
and more desolate than the Sahara.

I survived distance. Wrote one message after another
beginning with a capital letter and a ""PS."" at the end.
My own personal post office under my pillow
closed for two years already, on holiday.

I survived six month-long polar days and nights;
to this day, I don't know which one was worse.

My epitaph is simple. Carved in granite:
FRANK WILD
18 April 1873
19 August 1939
“Shackleton’s
Right Hand Man”
From those cast away here
by a defect in the engine of the ship
or nostalgia of the womb.


2.
Ah yes. . . in the beginning was the ship. The ship stuck in ice.
Endurance.
Ships are women. They prefer soft seas.
In the best-case scenario, she’s called La Santa Maria
and she throws you, like Columbus, on some foreign shore.

But if you get too close to her. . .

The very day after
we washed her deck with warm water and soap,
warmed her arteries with gin,
stroked her lower back with our surrogate songs,
shaved our beards and exposed the illiterate lines on our faces,
she took off.

And from the shore,
we saw how she broke her ribs, sinking,
aft first, so fast we didn’t even have time to pray,
leaving behind her ash-tree fragrance
and faux pearls on the water.

“Such a woman!” someone laughed bitterly,
“She knows when to leave so as not to be forgotten.”


3.
A woman, naturally, has no business there.
Antarctica is a masculine continent—
male penguins keep the eggs warm,
the moon stands up on the street to urinate
after being kicked out of the tavern,
the cold like a cut-throat razor, dulled for three thousand years,
and the sled dogs, the Huskies,
we kill with a single bullet
so they won’t starve to death. In this way
we instill a little character into the new land
before the arrival of Conquistadors, thieves,
assassins, missionaries, prostitutes,
the first invading army of every continent.

Antarctica is a man’s continent,
because only a man chooses to break into the darkness of the mind
by conquering the body,
as Amundsen and Scott did, their glory
reaching to the apex of ecstasy.
Zero degree of geographical latitude,
utter collapse.


4.
Hunger is overestimated. The stomach functions much like the
brain:
when it has nothing to think about, it feeds off memories.
It can last three days just thinking of a single biscuit.
But those who have a better memory, meaning a much stronger
acidity,
can go on for months
remembering a slice of prosciutto, two fried eggs,
sweetly folding their eyelids like napkins after a meal.

Then hallucinations begin. Banquets. Easter supper.
Feet move impatiently under the table;
the scent of rosemary wafts from a platter
and two clean serving hands with burns here and there.
That's when you feel grief-stricken
and you attack the seals and penguins with your
alpine knives and shoes like a madman
in an empty amphitheater.
Or is this, too, a hallucination,
and in this case not ours
but Antarctica's?

And when clarity finally returns,
both stomach and brain
notice only their own deep wrinkles.


5.
Blubber, blubber, seal's blubber.
Blubber that keeps your spirits alive, rendering it for fuel, for light,
blubber to mask the body's foul odor,
—a mixture of doubt, hope, and ammonia.
And if you have nothing better to do,
think of a cow's thigh hanging at the butcher's,
its delicate streak of fat
like a silk ribbon.

I survived even this sarcasm.

And every night, before bed,
we read recipes to each other
one of a few things we secretly rescued
from the ship before she sank,
as if these items were her lingerie.

What a show it was!
What pathos in pronouncing prosciutto, sugar, omelet!
What sensuality in milk, parsley, cinnamon!
We made these words up ourselves.
Nothing exists until its moment of absence.

But first, in order to warm up our mouths
like actors before going on stage,
we'd repeat mechanically, palates dry,
""Bless us, O Lord,
and this food we've received through your mercy.”


6.
It was the Romans who spoiled the word
studying rhetoric
before anatomy and mathematics:
Vir bonus dicendi peritus
“The good man skilled in speaking"" (Marcus Porcius Cato)

But in Antarctica, words are measured differently: by calories!
With a simple greeting you lose five calories,
just as many to keep a fire burning for a full minute.
And a Ciceronian argument can consume a whole day’s
nutrition;
think carefully before you open your mouth.

The word is overestimated.

Sometimes it’s enough to avert your eyes from your shoes
to imply “gangrene”;
and a vague exchange of glances between men
is enough to understand that the ice is cracking beneath your feet
and death is closer than your fingers.


7.
Stretched smooth from end to end—such is Antarctica. In fact,
even a baby’s skin looks withered by comparison.
No emotions. No regrets. No warnings.
Either fight or die.

My father was like this more or less. A teacher at a village school.
In classrooms that smelled of sheep-wool pullovers
drying on the body. And eyes that moved freely
in their hollows, like toes
inside an older sibling’s shoes.

Unlike the Romans,
my father preached about justice and honor
his hands folded behind his back.
His shoulders seemed twice as wide
as his worn jacket.

I inherited his sharp, gray gaze
and his soft voice.
Eyes that say “Go” and a voice that says “Stay.”
You never know which one to trust.


8.
And mother? Oh, she was simply Captain Cook’s niece,
—the great James Cook—
from morning to night
when she washed, swept, dug potatoes from the garden,
fixed her husband’s tie on Sundays
even from her bed, while in labor.
She never spoke of this. As it wasn’t necessary.
People speak of what they have, not what they are.

She was a tailor. Measured everyone's perimeter with a glance;
erred only on the width of one’s neck, an unknown strength.
Her large scissors followed
the white chalk line on the cloth so precisely. ""Snip!""
She said little. Her silence followed the white outlines
of another tailor,
over a fabric much older than she was.

But now that I think of it,
how did the poor woman respond to her friends asking,
""Where is your son?""
""He's exploring the world.""
""And what does he bring back from there?""
""Himself, alive, I hope.""
""What's the point of returning empty-handed after two years?”

Was she at least a little proud of me? Of her Frank?
Certainly not. She was Captain Cook's niece.
The past always conquers.


9.
I was the first of thirteen children.
And as a rule, each of them
eyed one of my belongings.
One eyed my bed near the window
that overlooked the water where frogs lived
and asparagus grew on the shore.
Another eyed my green jacket bought with borrowed money,
poker cards, a fishing net,
my wicker chair with the damaged back.
Another whistled my favorite tune:
""What Will We Do with a Drunken Sailor?”
without reaching the refrain.
And yet another envied the basement
—that place I occupied in my father’s heart—
with its elm door hanging by a single hinge.

But the time hasn't come to leave home just yet,
until your own brother begins to use your shaving kit
and dreams of the same girl.


10.
What shaving kit? Antarctica makes you grow a double-beard
as if you were a hundred-year-old grave.
And, while you remember wasting time waiting in line at
barber's
another beard grows, a red one.

Here, each body part works for itself:
the stomach, hands, intestines, eyes. . .
The unity of the body is overestimated, too.

Only skin pulls everything together like a sled.
The skin? Which skin? Man loses his first skin
to his first love, like the snake early in spring
on a thorn-apple bush that blocks the way.
From that point on he stops counting the rest.


11.
I don’t know why it was named “Elephant Island,”
when it answered the ocean with the cries of a she-wolf.
We could only make out her sly teats under her belly. After
some time,
if she didn’t kill us first, we’d begin to cry like wolves ourselves.

Twenty-two people. Packed next to one another under two
inverted boats
like notes in Bach’s “Come, Sweet Death, Come Blessed Rest,”
with more pauses, a dramatic suffocation between breaths.
A dry, calcic cough was a sign of life. Or the delirious mutterings
of someone
dreaming aloud of “ice” in the middle of ice,
after they had cut off his toes.

But the hardest moment arrives in the morning,
when, with shut eyes and plugged nostrils,
as if drinking your own urine
you recycle the same lie for four months straight:
“Men, pack up your stuff! The boss might arrive today!”

And they obeyed me. Packed carefully each day from the start,
leaving nothing shap in the folds of their bags,
nothing that would spoil the line between fact and fiction.

It was a time when
routine grew more powerful than hope.


12.
Fish in the ocean toyed with our citizenship.
On the seventh mile, we left our medals behind, class ranks,
along with the dogs, potatoes, and a camera.
We made fire out of money
and kept only a single metal coin each
so that archaeologists might trace us more easily centuries later.
On Elephant Island, we had to bid farewell even to tobacco,
tobacco which reminded us of village alleyways
and walks home after midnight.

Time glided above us without touching a single strand of our
hair—
nonexistent, as if gliding above ancient cities,
exposing the solemnity of our white bones
and crickets on absent walls.

That’s when the ten commandments deserted us:
“Do not steal,” “Do not lie,” “Do not covet,”
“Honor your parents”. . .
save one of them perhaps,
the one about the holiness of Sunday.

We already had nothing. We belonged to no one.
An entirely new species: HOMO ANTARCTICUS.
A scientific proof that “forgotten” and “free”
mean the same thing.


13.
Two years after returning from the world of the dead,
you find your house taken over by another tenant
and the rent tripled,
the commemorative plaque nailed to the gate:
“Here lived F.W.”
And your lover, or better, ex-lover,
for the same reason,
in the arms of another
three times more handsome.

You see your own image sold at an auction.
Artifact. Original. “Brrramp. Sold!” The price so high
you can’t afford it. But even if you could,
you're an illegal customer,
holding a death certificate in your hand.

And you find your parents turned into winter trees
their eyes fixed on a large cloud of plaster.
They don’t expect visitors. Best not disturb them.
Let their leaves fall quietly where they will
let the crow's nest remain in the armpit of a branch,
where it has always been.

Perhaps you should take a shortcut, start over.
Or you know what? There’s a war going on nearby, they say.
Go there instead!
But this time die better.


14.
War’s never satisfied with flesh;
Fresh, branded, smoked,
with or without blood
blue blood, dark, thick, whatever kind.
And frozen blood like yours
could store at minus 40 degrees Celsius,
viruses from 1914 unscathed,
and the map of the old Empire
and Scott's hurt ego
and old coins minted with the head of Edward VII,
and Browning’s poetry and the epic of the unknown,
like an envelope inside an envelope,
all making you the ideal candidate.

Back on the ship, ammunition everywhere,
sailing through the cold Northern seas
where you had to learn a new language.
A new language is like a fish:
first, you need to remove its spine
in order to chew it.

Unlike in Antarctica,
one’s purpose in war is clear: kill or be killed,
though sometimes it’s the same difference.

Baltic nights gave you what Antarctica refused you:
the other half of the celestial sphere.
You meet Vera, the widow of a tea plantation owner,
a character out of a Baroque novel, her pupils blurred with dusk,
and the ritual of mourning fitted perfectly to her body
like a final journey.


15.
A man charmed by a glacier,
who knows too well the flawless forms of her body,
feels her eavesdropping gaze even when asleep,
her clean and distant breath
and her heart, a piece of ice, that melts inside a cigarette case
heated for drinking water,
finds it difficult to marry a real woman,
to marry Vera.
And Africa.

I bought land. Barren. Hundreds of acres. In Zululand.
I didn’t fare well with tobacco. Planted cotton instead,
chose bodily peace rather than meditation.
My nearest neighbor lived 45 miles away. White, of course.
And my fate, never blended with the blacks,
those beautiful statues, wrapped in straw.
I heard them nod off during lunch break,
like the oars of a boat,
in complete sync.
They knew where they were heading.
But I didn’t.

And I was right. It didn’t take long
before drought, floods, worms
destroyed everything. The bank left me only my own beard
and the malarial shadow of a baobab. Apart from other things,
Vera filled out divorce papers. The woman in the yellow dress,
yellow as quinine, yellow as the sigh of a hinge at dusk,
the woman married to the hero
who now can’t even manage a small plot of land.


16.
The man in front of me
—my master I call ""Boss""—
is newly shaved, and dressed in a striped tie and jacket
as if the Prince of Wales or Fred Astaire,
a style that arrives here two years late.
He asks me to serve whiskey to clients at the bar
and chat them up
using their jargon, gestures,
sentences uninterrupted by mosquitoes,
and the abstract rhetoric of the Depression years.
And, to be frank,
he pays me for the latter.

But what do I know,
what does a survivor know about the art of living,
for which new instincts are needed, new muscles
and other kinds of heart valves?

Furthermore,
how can I obey such a spick-and-span boss,
having known the smoky gods of Antarctica
who recognize each other solely by the nose
and can end rebellions with a glance
and count the deaths as members of the crew?
How can I take orders from a boss whose name isn't Shackleton?


17.
""Second in command,” “Lieutenant,” “Shackleton’s right hand”

What did she see so clearly in me,
my drama teacher in elementary school
when she'd always assign me the role of Father Joseph,
of Gaspar the Magi offering Jesus frankincense,
or of John the Baptist always there to clear the path?
What did she see in my metallic pupils, baritone voice,
infrequent speech
as if scissors, bandage, and iodine
inside a first aid kit?

Under Antarctica's naked sky, each of us followed his own star.
Even the carpenter, his own heraldic calling.
You didn’t need much to feed them;
just a few crusts of insomnia and the tents' punctured holes.

My star was weak; you could hardly see it
hidden behind another larger, troubled star
like a calm valley that appears behind jagged peaks
more attractive when absent.


18.
What happened afterward can be told in a few words:
I worked in a mine; earth’s warm heart,
happened to be crueler than her frozen brain.
I laid railroad tracks South, always toward the Unknown.
It was like playing only two strings on a violin: joy and sorrow,
fatefully blending at the horizon.

I repaired houses. Another waste of time.
I never understood their weak points,
just as you can't make out eyes from genitals or mouth
in some underwater creatures.

And when I was left penniless,
I gave lectures about Antarctica,
water gurgling in my gullet every five words, for those few
who listened patiently to an adventure of survival.

Then Bea arrived. Or sweet Beatrice.
It was easy to grant her what I had left in my heart
—that set of heavy museum keys—
with no fear she might lose them.

Tired lungs and liver
could barely follow my split image
of bust and bottle of booze.
Like a prophet in the last circle of Dante’s Inferno,
I carried my own decapitated head in hand.

My ashes were lost at the base of a church. No one
thought of them.
It was a time of war. Another world war. The second
one not knowing what to do with her own ashes either.


19.
Some of us died in the war.  Others took to the sea again,
the gray, cracked waters of the South,
decks perspiring fuel and alcohol.
Our random itineraries. Full-time melancholics.

For months in Antarctica,
we waited for our shadow to return
and consumed that question you ask yourself only once in your
lifetime,
the way one consumes chickenpox.

And the rest of the time,
we counted the scars left on our faces,
with a gesture you could call indifferent and epic,
or childlike.

1. A man can stand with both feet touching the ground until his legs no longer reach that far, until the ground disappears.               2. Giant Baba stands six feet ten inches tall, taller in Japan. It doesn’t matter how tall you are.             3. A man can hold a woman, can’t stand to lose her to the heart’s wreckage. His body will fall apart one day—a rock crab’s chassis stripped clean by seagulls, a dandelion gone to seed.              4. Giant Baba stands over seven feet tall. When he lifts you over his head, you will be eight and a half feet above the ground.               5. A man can stand for anything when seen from below—fatherhood, majesty, satisfaction after conquest.

To keep me from staying out late at night,  my mother warned of the Hell Pig. Black and full of hot drool, eyes the color of a lung—it'd follow me home if I stayed past my curfew. How to tell my friends to press Pause in the middle of a video, say their good-byes while I shuffled up the stairs and into my father's waiting blue car? How to explain this to my dates, whisper why we could not finish this dance? It's not like the pig had any special powers or could take a tiny bite from my leg—only assurances that it was simply scandal to be followed home. When my date and I pull into my driveway and dim the lights, we take care to make all the small noises that get made in times like these even smaller: squeaks in the seats,  a slow spin of the radio dial, the silver click of my belt.  Too late. A single black hair flickers awake the ear of the dark animal waiting for me at the end of the walk.  My fumbling of keys and various straps a wild dance to the door—the pig grunting in tune to each hurried step, each of his wet breaths puffing into tiny clouds, a small storm brewing.

A species of tiny human has been discovered, which lived on the remote Indonesian island of Flores just 18,000 years ago. . . . Researchers have so far unearthed remains from eight individuals who were just one metre tall, with grapefruit-sized skulls. These astonishing little people . . . made tools, hunted tiny elephants and lived at the same time as modern humans who were colonizing the area.

Light: lifted, I stretch my brief body. Color: blaze of day behind blank eyes. Sound: birds stab greedy beaks Into trunk and seed, spill husk Onto the heap where my dreaming And my loving live. Every day I wake to this. Tracks follow the heavy beasts Back to where they huddle, herd. Hunt: a dance against hunger. Music: feast and fear. This island becomes us. Trees cap our sky. It rustles with delight In a voice green as lust. Reptiles Drag night from their tails, Live by the dark. A rage of waves Protects the horizon, which we would devour. One day I want to dive in and drift, Legs and arms wracked with danger. Like a dark star. I want to last.

— John Ruskin, letter to Susan Beever, from Assisi, Sacristan’s Cell, June 25, 1874
To-day, being my sixty-first birthday, I would ask leave to say a few words to the friends who care for me, and the readers who are anxious about me, touching the above-named illness itself. For a physician’s estimate of it, indeed, I can only refer them to my physicians. But there were some conditions of it which I knew better than they could: namely, first, the precise and sharp distinction between the state of morbid inflammation of brain which gave rise to false visions (whether in sleep, or trance, or waking, in broad daylight, with perfect knowledge of the real things in the room, while yet I saw others that were not there), and the not morbid, however dangerous, states of more or less excited temper, and too much quickened thought, which gradually led up to the illness, accelerating in action during the eight or ten days preceding the actual giving way of the brain.

A pensive study of old clothes sun-sipped dry in the Jews’ quarter, hanging out of a marble architrave smashed & built into a piece of Roman frieze moldering into broken brickwork projected over wooden windows propped on gray entablature. A vestige of yet-legible inscription: nomine fortuna. No important lines, no beauty of object. A pendent hodgepodge of contrasted feeling cheesecaked into picturesque febrility. An episode. A grief in, as it were, parenthesis. A match without a marriage, as after news of an engagement. A church embedded sans façade among the common sort of houses. A succor from St. Peter’s mere bewilderment & worry. Graphite heightened w/ touches of white body color on gray-green paper.

Beresford Chapel, Walworth: a bare, oblong,
low-ceilinged barn, each brick-arched window filled
with small-paned glass requiring iron bars
threaded like halves of cobweb to stay true.
No traceries, no clustered shafts, no vaulting.
No fantasies. No perpendicular flights
of aspiration. Clean lines, and severe.
Pews shut-in with partitions of plain deal
and neatly brass-hatched doors. No pulpit, merely
a stout, four-legged box of well-grained wainscot,
but decorated with a velvet cushion — 
crimson, with golden tassels at the corners — 
which formed my one resource, for when I tired
of Dr. Andrews’s sermon I could watch
the colors texturing the folds & creases
each time he thumped it. Beresford. That’s where
we worshipped: Papa, Mama, and I.
Poor preparation, this, for Rouen! Rouen
wardered by groups of solemn statuary
clasped by stems of sculpted leafage crowned
by fretted niche & fairy pediment
like inextricably meshed gossamer;
Rouen with her surge & foam of pious chivalry
breaking on crystal cliffs to stand revealed
as every hidden thing shall be, insatiable at prayer
or pillage, lending grace to English rudeness,
venom to Italy’s cunning    ...    Rouen with all
her avarice & intricacies, gargoyles
open-mawed, molten, drenching ornament
down spires vertiginously pinnacled — 
insanae substructiones! Inutiles domos! — 
yet piping pastoral songs of innocence — 
 

The Palazzo Contarini-Fasan, Venice (1841). Higgledy terraced structures the colors of ice creams & sorbets w/ no bland tinting. No calligraphic decoration. Graphite, watercolor & body color. A thorough spell in the vernacular. Stone filigree spidering rhythmic tessellations w/ some scratching out. Details that become a refuge. Detail that becomes a refuge. A long-drawn replica in which new life may even now be in the offing. A sulky grandeur, by the bye. A naughty jailer. A determined postulant. A barber-pole mooring post. A dipped oar tilting  for trouble. The Doge’s tottering state stepping off on gray paper.


Worn somewhat, and not a little weary,
Sandro’s uncommon Fortitude, in this
his first recorded work. Consider it
a moment, if you please, before you pass
hurriedly on to see The Birth of  Venus
next door, and notice that Sandro began
where you perhaps will end: with weariness.
Would you have guessed that Fortitude allows
(allows? approves of!) reverie? See how
her fingers play in restless idleness
or nervousness about her sword hilt
(sword or mace? I’ve lost my notes about her    ...    ).
She is no match, it may be, for the trials
that are to come, yet see her armor shine
in readiness, her gentle fingers apt
to grip her sword (or mace) should she be called.
Lips pursed and eyes averted, she has smiled,
and not a little ruefully, at her fate
from time to time. She has no smile today.
Her quality must be borne daylong, lifelong.
To flaunt it ever is not to possess
it quite. See Pollaiolo’s Virtues pose
and attitudinize: thus they perform
their various meanings. Fortitude must
contain — must be — all that she stands for. Go,
see whatever the Uffizi has
to tempt you; but remember Fortitude
whose battle did not begin today,
nor yesterday, nor on the Sunday last.
Many a day has passed since it began.
They are so wedded to their righteousness,
those lesser Virtues, quite incapable
of  being tempted. They would not dare risk
complacency. She would be lost without it.
But sword or mace? Go now. It is no matter.
I will not need you until tomorrow morning.
 

Ravine at Maglans (1849?). Deeper brown on brown. A limestone precipice stepped with horizontal cleavages to overlook the void. No water but a dream of water years back, far down, running harum-scarum strong enough to turn a mill. A spate become a thread. A visit out of season. A torrent bed of what must have been snow-melt now entirely dry. No stones crumble but flow, subside, rhythmic as cloud, as high-built, as unsubstantial over the long haul. Quartz strips ribboning a treed crevasse fringed w/ curled & unfurled fronds. Leaves shook to palsy by the noon wind’s spite. A rock fissured. A great fault. A graphite rock fissured in brown ink & ink wash heightened w/ flesh-toned body color on white paper.


Last night St. Ursula sent me her dianthus
out of her bedroom window, with her love — 
living dianthus, and a single dried
sprig of  her other window flower, vervain    ...    
how many flowers are named in Genesis?
Good answer! Not one. Plenty of trees, however.
It was a poet planted flowerbeds
that Eden might be filled with tremulous,
frivolous petals — I dare say he was right,
they were made to be noticed! And to see
a poppy husk fall from a bursting flower
is to know something of the life to come
once the body has turned to dust & ashes,
even as our dying breath aspires
toward our Father’s house    ...    as for the trees,
what can we learn of noble constancy
more than we find in the pure laurel leaf,
so numerable, so sequent and serene?
 
open the envelope
petals & may
spill on the table
where I remain
preparing the lesson
 

bruise-edged rose petals
cling to my fingers
dust motes dancing
gnats in a sun-shaft
myrrh, or a snuffbox?
 

write to me, tell me
who do you dance with
oftenest, often?
gray eyes & red cheeks
useless in heaven
 

undowered, garlanded
with no forget-me-nots:
compassed about
with the forgetfulness
of all the world
 

honor unwon
kind words unsaid
good deeds undone:
none of these, none
touch me more nearly

Now, if  I say “St. Ursula has sent me
a pot of pinks!” some will say I have goneheartily, headily mad, but all it means
is that the flowers I received of  late
(from the hand of whatsoever friend or stranger)
helped greatly in my work, and afterward
reproved me in their own way for its failure.But how much love of mine have others lost
because one poor sick child would not receive
the part of love that yet belongs to her!
Think now, sweet milkmaids of Albion
whose face is your fortune, think of one
lying still there, nearly a skeleton,
and ask yourselves: We have a little sister and she has no breasts: what shall we do for our sister in the day of  her espousals?
 

South Side of the Basilica of St. Mark’s, Venice, from the Loggia of the Ducal Palace (c.1851). An eerie vantage. A capricious helter-skelter variety of application, quickening details of watercolor passing  for time-veined marble scaled-up from a daguerreotype. An echo’s volume. Shadows lilt & flourish over chessboard floor tiles. A kind of hectic color. Disallowance of perspective. Sculpted relief without recession. Megrims & mysteries; conceits & divertisements. The uncapped St. Jean d’Acre’s pillar giving on to the southern portico. A Byzantine capital. A sonata on a virginal. Graphite & watercolor heightened w/ white on three jointed pieces of paper.


           Up my spirit leapt, so glad
           to shed this gross flesh and have done!
           My ghost, given up by the grace of God,
           was led where marvels are counted common.
           I climbed to where cliff-top meets cloud — 
           vertiginous heights no man has known — 
           my soul drawn on toward a wood
           decked with countless jewels & stones.
           It is hard to credit a sight so fine
           as the wash of  light in which they shone:
           woman never wove a gown
           so dearly adorned, so lit with splendor.
           In splendor, cliffs of crystal stood
           crisp as ice, clear & clean.
           At their foot, a forest spread:
           the trees were touched with a red-blue sheen
           and leaves of  burnished silver slid
           quivering to & fro between
           limbs that shimmered like blue jade
           each time a light-gleam touched the scene.
           The gravel underfoot was strewn
           with gems, and the sun seemed quite outshone
           by those precious, oriental stones
           so dearly adorned, so lit with splendor.
           The splendor of the grove was such
           that my grief left me — it lifted clear;
           the fragrance of the fruit so fresh,
           I found I needed no other fare.
           Birds flew together, branch to branch
           like flecks of flame — now here now there;
           no human symphony can match,
           nor voice nor string delight the ear
           with such a song: they blessed the air
           with a sweet accord that swooned & shone
           with harmonies you will never hear
           but there where all is lit with splendor.
           So adorned in splendor was
           that forest where I met my fate,
           a cunning man could not devise
           a fitting way to tell of it.
           Climbing pear trees, apple trees;
           browsing wonders — pretty sport!
           And soon the flowers & fields & hedgerows
           turned beautifully intricate
           with burns & water gardens. Bright
           as burnished gold the fellside shone
           where I trailed a stream that ran with light,
           dearly adorned & lit with splendor.
           But a greater splendor was yet to come:
           a riverbank of  beryl ablaze
           where water swept & swirled in a foam
           of  hurrying murmurs & confused airs.
           The stream bed glinted with a gleam
           like sunlight filtered through stained glass
           or winter starlight, when it may seem
           we’re all alone when the clouds pass.
           Each pebble bright as Hesperus:
           sapphire, emerald — each one shone
           with a light too bright for similes,
           dearly adorned & lit with splendor.
 

Study of Gneiss Rock, Glenfinlas (1853–54). A living witness. A verticality more smooth than the water over wch it rears. Glib-channeled water rushing; dry rock dripping — fluid, labial rock, less still than the wildflowers & feathered grasses that cling in unguessed cracks & overhang. Mapped lichens. Lampblack, body color. A cumbrous slab. An unobtrusive majesty. A happenstance long sought before seen, loved long before understood. A lesson of devotion to be found always, found but once. An obstinacy gladdened by the river’s flux, the ice floe’s pluck & laving. Pen & ink over graphite on wove paper w/ some scratching out.


In Santa Croce, here we are
well quit of restoration, for who cares
about this slab with its poor bit of sculpture?
An old man in the deeply-folded cap

The worn face, still the old man’s perfect portrait — 
though one struck out by a master’s chisel
at a venture, just so, with a few rough touches;
the falling drapery of  his citizen’s cap
subtle beyond description, with the choice of folds
exquisite in its ornamental pattern;
the carpet he lies on almost uninjured,
elaborate with fringe & frond
relieving the severity of the figure    ...

Study of a Peacock’s Breast Feather (1873). A single plume, painted of its natural size. One iridescent throb transitioning from the active plume’s obliquity to the decorative’s dualed symmetry. An uncertain correspondence w/ a heart-shaped flower petal. A cold thrill: a pang as of a nice deep wasp sting. Moss green moving via jade to emerald, indigo to lapis lazuli: as much as is allowed, having neither hocus-pocus nor heaven to dip a brush in. A heraldic emblem; watch & ward against incipient commodity. A lost key to a blue box for blue girls w/ gray eyes. Watercolor & body color on paper.

Moss & Wild Strawberry (1873). Gentle, hesitant line. A suggestion in the genitive. A secret in midsummer. A slackening deft moss nested in cleaved stone. Traces of body color on gray-blue paper trefoiled w/ dewy sequins. Seekings. Rooting a subtle declivity in the rock revealed now by a berry’s posture. A gaze darkening where lines triangulate palely. A beckoning. A suggestive gesture.
In heaven I mean to go and talk to Pythagoras and Socrates and Valerius Publicola. I shan’t care a bit for Rosie there, she needn’t think it. What will grey eyes and red cheeks be good for there?
— John Ruskin, letter to Susan Beever, from Assisi, Sacristan’s Cell, June 25, 1874
To-day, being my sixty-first birthday, I would ask leave to say a few words to the friends who care for me, and the readers who are anxious about me, touching the above-named illness itself. For a physician’s estimate of it, indeed, I can only refer them to my physicians. But there were some conditions of it which I knew better than they could: namely, first, the precise and sharp distinction between the state of morbid inflammation of brain which gave rise to false visions (whether in sleep, or trance, or waking, in broad daylight, with perfect knowledge of the real things in the room, while yet I saw others that were not there), and the not morbid, however dangerous, states of more or less excited temper, and too much quickened thought, which gradually led up to the illness, accelerating in action during the eight or ten days preceding the actual giving way of the brain.
— John Ruskin, Fors Clavigera Letter 88 (February 8, 1880)
Too fast and far again! by much; the impetus of phrase running away with me.

                           My dear little birds,

Piazza Sta Maria del Pianto, Rome (1840). A pensive study of old clothes sun-sipped dry in the Jews’ quarter, hanging out of a marble architrave smashed & built into a piece of Roman frieze moldering into broken brickwork projected over wooden windows propped on gray entablature. A vestige of yet-legible inscription: nomine fortuna. No important lines, no beauty of object. A pendent hodgepodge of contrasted feeling cheesecaked into picturesque febrility. An episode. A grief in, as it were, parenthesis. A match without a marriage, as after news of an engagement. A church embedded sans façade among the common sort of houses. A succor from St. Peter’s mere bewilderment & worry. Graphite heightened w/ touches of white body color on gray-green paper.

Beresford Chapel, Walworth: a bare, oblong,
low-ceilinged barn, each brick-arched window filled
with small-paned glass requiring iron bars
threaded like halves of cobweb to stay true.
No traceries, no clustered shafts, no vaulting.
No fantasies. No perpendicular flights
of aspiration. Clean lines, and severe.
Pews shut-in with partitions of plain deal
and neatly brass-hatched doors. No pulpit, merely
a stout, four-legged box of well-grained wainscot,
but decorated with a velvet cushion — 
crimson, with golden tassels at the corners — 
which formed my one resource, for when I tired
of Dr. Andrews’s sermon I could watch
the colors texturing the folds & creases
each time he thumped it. Beresford. That’s where
we worshipped: Papa, Mama, and I.
Poor preparation, this, for Rouen! Rouen
wardered by groups of solemn statuary
clasped by stems of sculpted leafage crowned

Rouen with her surge & foam of pious chivalry
breaking on crystal cliffs to stand revealed
as every hidden thing shall be, insatiable at prayer

venom to Italy’s cunning    ...    Rouen with all
her avarice & intricacies, gargoyles
open-mawed, molten, drenching ornament
down spires vertiginously pinnacled — 
insanae substructiones! Inutiles domos! — 
yet piping pastoral songs of innocence — 
 

The Palazzo Contarini-Fasan, Venice (1841). Higgledy terraced structures the colors of ice creams & sorbets w/ no bland tinting. No calligraphic decoration. Graphite, watercolor & body color. A thorough spell in the vernacular. Stone filigree spidering rhythmic tessellations w/ some scratching out. Details that become a refuge. Detail that becomes a refuge. A long-drawn replica in which new life may even now be in the offing. A sulky grandeur, by the bye. A naughty jailer. A determined postulant. A barber-pole mooring post. A dipped oar tilting  for trouble. The Doge’s tottering state stepping off on gray paper.


Worn somewhat, and not a little weary,
Sandro’s uncommon Fortitude, in this
his first recorded work. Consider it
a moment, if you please, before you pass
hurriedly on to see The Birth of  Venus
next door, and notice that Sandro began
where you perhaps will end: with weariness.
Would you have guessed that Fortitude allows
(allows? approves of!) reverie? See how
her fingers play in restless idleness
or nervousness about her sword hilt
(sword or mace? I’ve lost my notes about her    ...    ).
She is no match, it may be, for the trials
that are to come, yet see her armor shine
in readiness, her gentle fingers apt
to grip her sword (or mace) should she be called.
Lips pursed and eyes averted, she has smiled,
and not a little ruefully, at her fate
from time to time. She has no smile today.
Her quality must be borne daylong, lifelong.
To flaunt it ever is not to possess
it quite. See Pollaiolo’s Virtues pose
and attitudinize: thus they perform
their various meanings. Fortitude must
contain — must be — all that she stands for. Go,
see whatever the Uffizi has
to tempt you; but remember Fortitude
whose battle did not begin today,
nor yesterday, nor on the Sunday last.
Many a day has passed since it began.
They are so wedded to their righteousness,
those lesser Virtues, quite incapable
of  being tempted. They would not dare risk
complacency. She would be lost without it.
But sword or mace? Go now. It is no matter.
I will not need you until tomorrow morning.
 

Ravine at Maglans (1849?). Deeper brown on brown. A limestone precipice stepped with horizontal cleavages to overlook the void. No water but a dream of water years back, far down, running harum-scarum strong enough to turn a mill. A spate become a thread. A visit out of season. A torrent bed of what must have been snow-melt now entirely dry. No stones crumble but flow, subside, rhythmic as cloud, as high-built, as unsubstantial over the long haul. Quartz strips ribboning a treed crevasse fringed w/ curled & unfurled fronds. Leaves shook to palsy by the noon wind’s spite. A rock fissured. A great fault. A graphite rock fissured in brown ink & ink wash heightened w/ flesh-toned body color on white paper.


Last night St. Ursula sent me her dianthus
out of her bedroom window, with her love — 
living dianthus, and a single dried
sprig of  her other window flower, vervain    ...    
how many flowers are named in Genesis?
Good answer! Not one. Plenty of trees, however.
It was a poet planted flowerbeds
that Eden might be filled with tremulous,
frivolous petals — I dare say he was right,
they were made to be noticed! And to see
a poppy husk fall from a bursting flower
is to know something of the life to come
once the body has turned to dust & ashes,
even as our dying breath aspires
toward our Father’s house    ...    as for the trees,
what can we learn of noble constancy
more than we find in the pure laurel leaf,
so numerable, so sequent and serene?
 
open the envelope
petals & may
spill on the table
where I remain
preparing the lesson
 

bruise-edged rose petals
cling to my fingers
dust motes dancing
gnats in a sun-shaft
myrrh, or a snuffbox?
 

write to me, tell me
who do you dance with
oftenest, often?
gray eyes & red cheeks
useless in heaven
 

undowered, garlanded
with no forget-me-nots:
compassed about
with the forgetfulness
of all the world
 

honor unwon
kind words unsaid
good deeds undone:
none of these, none
touch me more nearly

Now, if  I say “St. Ursula has sent me
a pot of pinks!” some will say I have goneheartily, headily mad, but all it means
is that the flowers I received of  late
(from the hand of whatsoever friend or stranger)
helped greatly in my work, and afterward
reproved me in their own way for its failure.But how much love of mine have others lost
because one poor sick child would not receive
the part of love that yet belongs to her!
Think now, sweet milkmaids of Albion
whose face is your fortune, think of one
lying still there, nearly a skeleton,
and ask yourselves: We have a little sister and she has no breasts: what shall we do for our sister in the day of  her espousals?
 

South Side of the Basilica of St. Mark’s, Venice, from the Loggia of the Ducal Palace (c.1851). An eerie vantage. A capricious helter-skelter variety of application, quickening details of watercolor passing  for time-veined marble scaled-up from a daguerreotype. An echo’s volume. Shadows lilt & flourish over chessboard floor tiles. A kind of hectic color. Disallowance of perspective. Sculpted relief without recession. Megrims & mysteries; conceits & divertisements. The uncapped St. Jean d’Acre’s pillar giving on to the southern portico. A Byzantine capital. A sonata on a virginal. Graphite & watercolor heightened w/ white on three jointed pieces of paper.


           Up my spirit leapt, so glad
           to shed this gross flesh and have done!
           My ghost, given up by the grace of God,
           was led where marvels are counted common.
           I climbed to where cliff-top meets cloud — 
           vertiginous heights no man has known — 
           my soul drawn on toward a wood
           decked with countless jewels & stones.
           It is hard to credit a sight so fine
           as the wash of  light in which they shone:
           woman never wove a gown
           so dearly adorned, so lit with splendor.
           In splendor, cliffs of crystal stood
           crisp as ice, clear & clean.
           At their foot, a forest spread:
           the trees were touched with a red-blue sheen
           and leaves of  burnished silver slid
           quivering to & fro between
           limbs that shimmered like blue jade
           each time a light-gleam touched the scene.
           The gravel underfoot was strewn
           with gems, and the sun seemed quite outshone
           by those precious, oriental stones
           so dearly adorned, so lit with splendor.
           The splendor of the grove was such
           that my grief left me — it lifted clear;
           the fragrance of the fruit so fresh,
           I found I needed no other fare.
           Birds flew together, branch to branch
           like flecks of flame — now here now there;
           no human symphony can match,
           nor voice nor string delight the ear
           with such a song: they blessed the air
           with a sweet accord that swooned & shone
           with harmonies you will never hear
           but there where all is lit with splendor.
           So adorned in splendor was
           that forest where I met my fate,
           a cunning man could not devise
           a fitting way to tell of it.
           Climbing pear trees, apple trees;
           browsing wonders — pretty sport!
           And soon the flowers & fields & hedgerows
           turned beautifully intricate
           with burns & water gardens. Bright
           as burnished gold the fellside shone
           where I trailed a stream that ran with light,
           dearly adorned & lit with splendor.
           But a greater splendor was yet to come:
           a riverbank of  beryl ablaze
           where water swept & swirled in a foam
           of  hurrying murmurs & confused airs.
           The stream bed glinted with a gleam
           like sunlight filtered through stained glass
           or winter starlight, when it may seem
           we’re all alone when the clouds pass.
           Each pebble bright as Hesperus:
           sapphire, emerald — each one shone
           with a light too bright for similes,
           dearly adorned & lit with splendor.
 

Study of Gneiss Rock, Glenfinlas (1853–54). A living witness. A verticality more smooth than the water over wch it rears. Glib-channeled water rushing; dry rock dripping — fluid, labial rock, less still than the wildflowers & feathered grasses that cling in unguessed cracks & overhang. Mapped lichens. Lampblack, body color. A cumbrous slab. An unobtrusive majesty. A happenstance long sought before seen, loved long before understood. A lesson of devotion to be found always, found but once. An obstinacy gladdened by the river’s flux, the ice floe’s pluck & laving. Pen & ink over graphite on wove paper w/ some scratching out.

The worn face, still the old man’s perfect portrait —

at a venture, just so, with a few rough touches;
the falling drapery of  his citizen’s cap
subtle beyond description, with the choice of folds
exquisite in its ornamental pattern;

elaborate with fringe & frond
relieving the severity of the figure    ...    
and see now, see how the cushion’s nearly-perfect tassels
balance to fill the angles of the stone — 
 

Study of a Peacock’s Breast Feather (1873). A single plume, painted of its natural size. One iridescent throb transitioning from the active plume’s obliquity to the decorative’s dualed symmetry. An uncertain correspondence w/ a heart-shaped flower petal. A cold thrill: a pang as of a nice deep wasp sting. Moss green moving via jade to emerald, indigo to lapis lazuli: as much as is allowed, having neither hocus-pocus nor heaven to dip a brush in. A heraldic emblem; watch & ward against incipient commodity. A lost key to a blue box for blue girls w/ gray eyes. Watercolor & body color on paper.

teach us how to give & hazard all

cannot be bargained otherwise — only lost.
Impregnable to our economies
whatever the deceiver promises,
the soul is not for sale. And now, the cost

     Diodati, a year with no summer,

Moss & Wild Strawberry (1873). Gentle, hesitant line. A suggestion in the genitive. A secret in midsummer. A slackening deft moss nested in cleaved stone. Traces of body color on gray-blue paper trefoiled w/ dewy sequins. Seekings. Rooting a subtle declivity in the rock revealed now by a berry’s posture. A gaze darkening where lines triangulate palely. A beckoning. A suggestive gesture.
In heaven I mean to go and talk to Pythagoras and Socrates and Valerius Publicola. I shan’t care a bit for Rosie there, she needn’t think it. What will grey eyes and red cheeks be good for there?
— John Ruskin, letter to Susan Beever, from Assisi, Sacristan’s Cell, June 25, 1874
To-day, being my sixty-first birthday, I would ask leave to say a few words to the friends who care for me, and the readers who are anxious about me, touching the above-named illness itself. For a physician’s estimate of it, indeed, I can only refer them to my physicians. But there were some conditions of it which I knew better than they could: namely, first, the precise and sharp distinction between the state of morbid inflammation of brain which gave rise to false visions (whether in sleep, or trance, or waking, in broad daylight, with perfect knowledge of the real things in the room, while yet I saw others that were not there), and the not morbid, however dangerous, states of more or less excited temper, and too much quickened thought, which gradually led up to the illness, accelerating in action during the eight or ten days preceding the actual giving way of the brain.

Too fast and far again! by much; the impetus of phrase running away with me.

A heraldic emblem; watch & ward against incipient commodity. A lost key to a blue box for blue girls w/ gray eyes. Watercolor & body color on paper.
Moss & Wild Strawberry (1873). Gentle, hesitant line. A suggestion in the genitive. A secret in midsummer. A slackening deft moss nested in cleaved stone. Traces of body color on gray-blue paper trefoiled w/ dewy sequins. Seekings. Rooting a subtle declivity in the rock revealed now by a berry’s posture. A gaze darkening where lines triangulate palely. A beckoning. A suggestive gesture.

There are places for chaos on the page, meaningful, apparent confusion — temps en temps on the continent does not mean “time to time” in Kent, or Greenwich. From stone through weeds and parchment, through bad times, words made their way to the printed page. Bibles now not just for those who go to worship by carriage, but for those who pray with bare feet, some washed, some smelling of stables and excrement. I’m not sure the words ocean and sea mean the same to you and me. Ninety-five percent universal confusion, dark matter was born with the legitimacy of an onion, the roar of a lion. I sit in the rumble seat of judgment, I damn myself for entertainment, for wasting time on hopeless entertainment. I am guilty of snarling lines, Gordian knots in my “Shakespeare” fishing reels. I must untangle this because eels have hearts like us. The enemy is symmetry. In the spring of content, I trust glorious chaos. I smell in disorder the outhouse of order. I must have respect for what I kill and eat, Jesus gave them loaves and fishes, not meat. He added, “Waste nothing you eat,” he did not say, “Waste is chaos made by me, or my Father, one person who is three.” Rebecca, at the well, said, “Drink. Water your camels.” I swear, my hands each on a Bible, the only evidence admissible is invisible. At twenty, I was lost in the snow, a sleigh bell. Chaos is not a “sometime thing,” its face and back are turned to and from us, what I cannot see is beautiful, or an isthmus that connects almost nothing to almost nothing —  the great unless, either/or. I grab on to metaphor, uncertainty, dark matter, gravity specific. The motto I nail to my door:The Devil generalizes, angels are specific. Chaos makes me merry, string or rose-by-any-other-rose theory, romance of the rose, roses that go with any other flower, from devil’s paintbrush to huckleberry. From fertile Chaos sprang Eros and Night: Chaos danced first with Eros, then jealous Night. Time carries a scythe, women and men sound the hour. I model for myself, I pose in north light. With helpers, his stevedore brothers, Hypnos and Thanatos, Charon still poles his familiar ferry across the Styx to an island where skeletons dance. Einstein said, “I too believe in appearance,” he didn’t think Old One plays dice, takes chances. You bet your bottom dollar the universe rhymes with another universe like verse. Yeats, Herrick, and Herbert would like that. To them, I lift my hat. Delphic chaos is wise, metaphoric thinking multiplies bunches of grapes, by tripod, by butterflies. Chaos is endless longing —  God’s pussycat. In Prague, Mozart knew a starling who sang his piano concerto all along, except for one note he always got wrong.

meaningful, apparent
confusion — temps en temps on the continent
does not mean “time to time” in Kent,
or Greenwich. From stone through weeds and parchment,
through bad times, words made their way to the printed page.
Bibles now not just for those who go to worship by carriage,
but for those who pray with bare feet,
some washed, some smelling of stables and excrement.

I’m not sure the words ocean and sea
mean the same to you and me.
Ninety-five percent universal confusion,
dark matter was born with the legitimacy
of an onion, the roar of a lion.
I sit in the rumble seat of judgment,
I damn myself for entertainment,
for wasting time on hopeless entertainment.
I am guilty of snarling lines, Gordian
knots in my “Shakespeare” fishing reels.
I must untangle this because eels
have hearts like us. The enemy
is symmetry.
In the spring of content,
I trust glorious chaos. I smell in disorder
the outhouse of order.

I must have respect for what I kill and eat,
Jesus gave them loaves and fishes, not meat.
He added, “Waste nothing you eat,”
he did not say, “Waste is chaos made by me,
or my Father, one person who is three.”
Rebecca, at the well,
said, “Drink. Water your camels.”
I swear, my hands each on a Bible,
the only evidence admissible is invisible.
At twenty, I was lost in the snow, a sleigh bell.

Chaos is not a “sometime thing,”
its face and back are turned to and from us,
what I cannot see is beautiful, or an isthmus
that connects almost nothing to almost nothing —
the great unless, either/or.
I grab on to metaphor,
uncertainty, dark matter, gravity specific.
The motto I nail to my door:
The Devil generalizes, angels are specific.
Chaos makes me merry,
string or rose-by-any-other-rose theory,
romance of the rose,
roses that go with any other flower,
from devil’s paintbrush to huckleberry.
From fertile Chaos sprang Eros and Night:
Chaos danced first with Eros, then jealous Night.
Time carries a scythe, women and men sound the hour.
I model for myself, I pose in north light.

With helpers, his stevedore brothers, Hypnos
and Thanatos, Charon still poles his familiar ferry
across the Styx to an island where skeletons dance.
Einstein said, “I too believe in appearance,”
he didn’t think Old One plays dice, takes chances.
You bet your bottom dollar the universe
rhymes with another universe like verse.
Yeats, Herrick, and Herbert would like that.
To them, I lift my hat.
Delphic chaos is wise,
metaphoric thinking multiplies
bunches of grapes, by tripod, by butterflies.
Chaos is endless longing —
God’s pussycat.
In Prague, Mozart knew a starling
who sang his piano concerto all along,

So we told him to tell those dudes to meet at the park, on a Friday night, 7 o’clock, and they would get the surprise of their lives. I was working a shift at the grocery store, the stiff apron covered in flour and scarred with dirt, wet from the spray nozzle a crooked crane in my hand. One of us had borrowed an enormous Cadillac. Racially inclusive casting to some, hiring kids from the neighborhood to us. What I remember was how much I wanted to go. It wasn’t so much that we were going to beat the shit out of fake roughnecks from the burbs who had no clue what they had coming. It was because I wanted to be one of the ants in a swarm. All my life I hid in the library reading about Greek heroes smiting their enemies. My best friend in the bunch was trying to convince me to skip out of work, even if it meant getting fired. I owed this minimum wage job nothing. My paychecks mostly went to my mom anyways. This was the critical moment in the hero’s journey and you’re going to miss it, he told me, though for sure he did not use those words. Of course I did not go — not because of cowardice, but for the much more boring reason that it did not seem proper for me to break the promise I made when I took this shitty job, to be there when I said I would, to clean what I would clean, break down what I would break down. They drove to that park as the dusk broke like a bloody egg over the nearby lake, blasting Ice Cube the entire way, his song disparaging Koreans seemingly not bothering the one Korean in the crew, and the suburban boys never even showed up. I am guessing they just smoked a bit and shouted over the too loud music and fit back into the warehouse of a car that could carry their stupid boy bodies over the roads, a Cadillac become Pegasus, none of our dreams having wings.

Let us descend into the blind world now.

As above, so below; as below, so above.

A Lowcountry marsh trembles with the blood of an African Who refused to climb out of the salt and mud of the bay And quite literally lost his head. A hunter named Hunter Waits for the man’s wounds to close and for him to rise Again. Some call this festive cruelty Paradise. Pleasure. Demby, the African made to rise and suffer another shot, Calls it the Afterlife, the unceasing blind world of death He welcomed expecting the end to his captivity and exile. But there is no end to the perfecting of cruelty even now In the Afterlife, where a hawk humped up in the high weeds And a house on fire are a congruent sadness, a brief history Of nature’s one duty for flesh — decay, decay, decay ...  Sometimes, it is as if every bird in the Afterlife trills this One song. And I forget who I am, but then I look down At my feet shuffling in darkness and hear my name —  Till ... Till ... Till ... And I know I am no farmer, blade Or mule driven over some roach-ragged road to field And fray, and sometimes I forget how I came here to After- Life, to pleasure, to domestic violence, to drive, be Driven, and then I look down at my hands. It is a war That brought you this peace, a war that brought you this peace. And then, I heard a question: “Shall we kill all of the masters?” And before I brokered an answer, I heard a voice say: “Then, we must kill ourselves, first. And who will Be left to kill the masters?” I turned to find nothing But a boy in a tree and a girl beside him, their heads Tolling in the wind like pecker-fretted fruit. Voice, I said, Come now or do not come at all. And there, a man I had seen before scratching in dust next to a drill field With a dictionary and a strange astronomy for a face. Ezra, is that you, I asked. “The peasants’ bent shoulders, Odysseus and the dead bullock — call me whatever you’d like. I come to every name like a white ox toward Pisa And the butcher’s road. I come to Paradise dragged By the hair ... with one day’s reading and surrendered Temple.” You do talk funny, I said. “He do the police In different voices,” he said. And when all the voices sound like the police, I said, kill all the voices. And so ran. I ran from Ezra who ran after me and demanded he be My guide. “There is no running from the forest of men. There is no running from men.” I’ll be damned, I said —  But before I could finish Ezra said, “That’s right. Be damned. Be here taloned and tumbling the sky down in Paradise. Here. Be in your cage and free.” But here is not the here I seek nor sought. For that here harangues me And I might as well be the nigger coming over The obstacle fence, a periplum of certain disaster, A choir of empty cups sitting loudly before the famished, Your prince, dear Ezra, hanging by his heels in the piazza, The sprezzatura of maggots rummaging the round heart For its divinity and pulse. Ezra, nothing of you but the dead. And so, I ran past the possum running through the skull Holes of a dead man lying in the fog that licked them Into a wet testimony, the possum testifying, too, to their death —  Coming, going, in ruins and floating out, out, beyond Their murders and dropped plates, out beyond the Thame-ish Rivers and its drowning traditions. And then I looked back And saw Ezra. He had come to his cage and could go no farther. “Till,” he said. “Bring me up from beneath these decks, One slaver to another.” He winked and I winked back, Handed him the katydid buzzing in my pocket, as I had done Before, dug a trench around him as another had done before, Then said, “Ezra, be here in your cage and free,” and ran. And then I came upon a mountain and then a chasm For which there was no bridge and so turned back To find a possum running behind me, and I asked him, Dear Possum, what do we do with this darkness Between us, and the possum said nothing and ran on Into the darkness, into the chasm and fell speaking of The end of touch, the desire to forget desire, shadows, The fear in a handful of dust, a woman’s mouth, Fear I had known of and visited though now I cringed At the thought of that violence, the violence that I brought —  And so thought to throw myself, too, in that chasm When a hand touched my shoulder, a voice said, “Not now, Maybe never. On we go, dear boy, through this weather. Let’s find us another theory of light. Or darkness.” Then, she laughed, for it was a woman with a lit darkness And a careful chin, glasses, her body a tin of tender. What do you know of me, I asked. She said, “Louis, I know of you as I know fog — that it comes on Through the alleys and past the dead boys and girls Who had not wanted to die in those alleys and ornament The city’s sight. Louis,” she said. “I’ve known all your light. But do you know mine?” And I hadn’t, I hadn’t. “I was a taken city burning,” she said, “a burning house Built to heal the sick, a sick house full of healing, The owl, moccasin, and panther — a rising For which there has never been such risen, the total Black. I is the total black. Flame and fox and knot Of the what-nots you would have forgotten if not for me, I am perfect fucking memory, no-dominion-defied, The god-head-glitter-gussied-up-for-the-going-down.” And though I thought I saw I had not seen. Instead Of one body, three. Women. And who and who and who, I asked. They laughed at my asking and said, “You Wouldn’t know us, but we will tell you our names —  Mother, Song, and Holy Yoke. Audre, Gwendolyn, And Lucille. Follow us. Or heel.” And where And where should I follow you? They did not answer, Instead, they walked on the edge of the abyss Laughing as if the abyss. “We are what is whatnot, The ever shimmying out of the never-wound. Louis, do you follow or do you fall,” They said. “Are you short or is you tall?” And on and on they played, pleasured, and pigeoned With each other, kiting sound and word between them As I have seen lovers do, passing cigarettes and smoke From one mouth to another, the smoke the shared body Of a God that has no master or mastering plan Other than abiding in darkness, abiding in both Its coronation and crucifixion. On and on we walked. And I followed. Beyond the bears chortling pears From Augustine’s outstretched hand, out beyond the river Scissoring the changing maple, its leaves ambering Then auburn then green each time a child appeared And touched its trunk. We stopped, watched. I asked Who are they. And the one full of light and knives answered, Waving at a few who journeyed to the edge of the water But did not wade in. And why don’t they wade in, I asked. She snickered, quieted, then said, “Wind and foxes, what was never mine but was and was.” As if she knew I did not understand, continued, “‘The ones I got but did not get,’ the wild hair they could not grow But scratches me now as it did once in a dream. Our abortions, Louis, our ones given and gave. Dem. The ones given all of their years at once. And none Or never.” And when she spoke, I saw another come To the shore and wave at me, a boy given and gave, the crushed- Color of late evening long after the pickers have come In and settled near a pot of ox bones boiling in the evening Of their own water, once again predicting the arch And strange astronomy of the flesh and its march march March to October and the battered soil. I mean I turned From the one waving because I could not be beneath The stairs of his steering and stare. Paradise, Why do you bring me to such weather? Why Would any man come down from his noose for this? “Because coming down is exactly the point. All heavens lesser and below heaven. Noose, not ...     You came to see what has become of death ...    ” The women spoke as one who had many tongues — All Holy Ghost and gut of a river gabbling over the white Stones. And where are we going, I asked. “Where language begins, Till.                                               Paradise. But over there.”    •                   And wasn’t this paradise that I had entered Through the thick marsh waters out of the cane                          The crowds fleeced of their living flesh at the far bank                  The intubated children with their gas masks                          Hanging from their hands and wandering       The sand in wet hospital gowns in this their new cancer                  Wasn’t this paradise                         A boy headphoned and heart drunk           Swaying at the back of the crowd mumbling to himself                        Started from the bottom now we’re here      Started from the bottom now my whole team is fucking here                                                                                           Wasn’t this paradise              The pigeons and finches flying back out                      Of  the pane-glassed windows they crashed through         The glass behind them opening and closing                                                              Like some never and wound                                                  Diastole systole the valve collapsing                   In its own beating sickness                   wasn’t this paradise                            The rows and rows of men on horseback                                                             The gnashing of  hoof in the heather         Everything ready to gallop or be galloped                                                   Except the men and women herded                    Into some queer parliament                  wasn’t this paradise                             To refuse to run at the behest of some horsemen         The running           how we arrived here         wasn’t this                    Paradise the end of running “Wasn’t this paradise,” asked a man Named Priam, a fence post cutting his head Into two hemispheres, his mutilations and wounds Closing, his two torn ears fluttering Upwards from a sack hanging from a horseman’s white Mare. “I was born with water in my voice, The problem of a fouled well, the Lord Gives us many, and I am the many given But he, even as he gives, does not give a given to take Or a given permitted to take. You see,” And Priam stretched his hand over the people, “We were a given taken and taken as a given. I mean we are a transgressed light, a transgressed People. We’ve been given this death. And now You want us to take another death, but a man Or woman can only take their one death. And we have taken, we have taken, we have Taken.” With each “taken” he pointed to the many, To the boy with headphones who could be heard Singing “Started from the bottom now we’re here,” To Demby to Aunt Hester to Sandra Bland, To Freddie Gray to Walter Scott to Eric Garner, His throat still crushed in his one hand Though in his other, a clutch of dry seeds And wherever he stepped a patch of trees sprouted. “Guides,” I asked, “where have I entered?” The names Of the dead rolled out along the field; the whole Field was counted — every maple, mango, muscadine, Larkspur, ant, vine, and moss — and there was no Answer from my guides. They stood beyond The queer parliament of the dead, and so I rushed over But could not make it to their portion of the field, The edge disappearing, the banks moving back from me. “We are not permitted,” they said. “We are not The dead of this dead. A different light. But go.” And then I heard my name; well, not my name But the name of my name, “Till, Till, Till.” And the men on the horses brought a boy up, His hands tied, and one spoke, “It is a god Who has given us this rest, this after and land, This mount and tarry for the good works Of our living. Why should we reject our peace? No harm lasts; we live forever in our wounds.” The man pulled his burgundy riding coat To the side and blood ran waterfall from his ribs, Onto his white britches. “And maybe,” a woman Spoke, “your wounds would close if you would let ours,” “But I am content in my wounds,” he said And closed his riding robe though the blood labored And labored. “I am content in my wounds. Maybe we’ve been given to you to teach You how to be content in yours,” he said. “Such is given, such is given of God, of a god.” The rider laughed and threw his head Backward and there a wound, too, where his neck Coupled with the skull, and the wound spoke But not the speech of  the mouth but the speech of reason, But not the reason of  Plato, Virgil, Foucault, Or the stars maddening the night with their bursts Of  madness, their dying in the night’s hair, But the reason of the spear that pierces The skull and slides through the chin, letting The darkness down, letting all the darkness down. “I see no God here nor one to come. Let down, Let down from your mount and execution Garden. You are no Nebuchadnezzar. But if you keep up this reckless lord And master, I will show you what beast You are from the inside out, give the leaves And spears of grass below a winter washing In your love.” The men on mounts shook Their reins and laughed. “And who are you,” They asked. “The perfection of water,” She answered. “The perfection of water.” The mounted man with blood running from his skull, Shook the rope holding the neck of the boy, Till. “Well,” he said, “call me the perfection Of slaughter. Teacher. Farmer. Daughter, move, I will till this after and life and land With whatever blade I choose, given or not. Have you misunderstood dominion — or me?” “I have and I have not,” she said. “I am Not your daughter. I am Oya, The mother of your slaughter. The mother Of this order.” The woman, Oya, bent down, touched The dry clods of soil. “Here, here is your god.” She held up the dirt to the noses Of the white horses. And water began falling From the sky. “I will show you how to touch The earth. I will show you how to die. Eric Garner Emmett Till Freddie Gray Korryn Gaines Trayvon Martin Martin Luther King  Jr. El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz Fred Hampton Kalief Browder Sandra Bland Rumain Brisbon Akai Gurley Tamir Rice Laquan McDonald Kajieme Powell Ezell Ford Dante Parker Michael Brown John Crawford III Tyree Woodson Victor White III Yvettte Smith McKenzie Cochran Jordan Baker Andy Lopez Miriam Carey Jonathan Ferrell Carlos Alcis Larry Jackson Jr. Kimani Gray Rekia Boyd Malissa Williams Timothy Russell Reynaldo Cuevas Chavis Carter Shantel Davis Henry Dumas Sharmel Edwards Shereese Francis Wendell Allen Deion Fludd.

— Three Initiates, “The Kybalion”
A Lowcountry marsh trembles with the blood of an African
Who refused to climb out of the salt and mud of the bay
And quite literally lost his head. A hunter named Hunter
Waits for the man’s wounds to close and for him to rise
Again. Some call this festive cruelty Paradise. Pleasure.
Demby, the African made to rise and suffer another shot,
Calls it the Afterlife, the unceasing blind world of death
He welcomed expecting the end to his captivity and exile.
But there is no end to the perfecting of cruelty even now
In the Afterlife, where a hawk humped up in the high weeds
And a house on fire are a congruent sadness, a brief history
Of nature’s one duty for flesh — decay, decay, decay ...
Sometimes, it is as if every bird in the Afterlife trills this
One song. And I forget who I am, but then I look down
At my feet shuffling in darkness and hear my name —
Till ... Till ... Till ... And I know I am no farmer, blade
Or mule driven over some roach-ragged road to field
And fray, and sometimes I forget how I came here to After-
Life, to pleasure, to domestic violence, to drive, be
Driven, and then I look down at my hands. It is a war
That brought you this peace, a war that brought you this peace.

And then, I heard a question: “Shall we kill all of the masters?”
And before I brokered an answer, I heard a voice say:
“Then, we must kill ourselves, first. And who will
Be left to kill the masters?” I turned to find nothing
But a boy in a tree and a girl beside him, their heads
Tolling in the wind like pecker-fretted fruit. Voice, I said,
Come now or do not come at all. And there, a man
I had seen before scratching in dust next to a drill field
With a dictionary and a strange astronomy for a face.
Ezra, is that you, I asked. “The peasants’ bent shoulders,
Odysseus and the dead bullock — call me whatever you’d like.
I come to every name like a white ox toward Pisa
And the butcher’s road. I come to Paradise dragged
By the hair ... with one day’s reading and surrendered
Temple.” You do talk funny, I said. “He do the police
In different voices,” he said. And when all the voices
sound like the police, I said, kill all the voices. And so ran.
I ran from Ezra who ran after me and demanded he be
My guide. “There is no running from the forest of men.
There is no running from men.” I’ll be damned, I said —
But before I could finish Ezra said, “That’s right. Be damned.

Be here taloned and tumbling the sky down in Paradise.
Here. Be in your cage and free.” But here is not the here
I seek nor sought. For that here harangues me
And I might as well be the nigger coming over
The obstacle fence, a periplum of certain disaster,
A choir of empty cups sitting loudly before the famished,
Your prince, dear Ezra, hanging by his heels in the piazza,
The sprezzatura of maggots rummaging the round heart
For its divinity and pulse. Ezra, nothing of you but the dead.
And so, I ran past the possum running through the skull
Holes of a dead man lying in the fog that licked them
Into a wet testimony, the possum testifying, too, to their death —
Coming, going, in ruins and floating out, out, beyond
Their murders and dropped plates, out beyond the Thame-ish
Rivers and its drowning traditions. And then I looked back
And saw Ezra. He had come to his cage and could go no farther.
“Till,” he said. “Bring me up from beneath these decks,
One slaver to another.” He winked and I winked back,
Handed him the katydid buzzing in my pocket, as I had done
Before, dug a trench around him as another had done before,
Then said, “Ezra, be here in your cage and free,” and ran.

And then I came upon a mountain and then a chasm
For which there was no bridge and so turned back
To find a possum running behind me, and I asked him,
Dear Possum, what do we do with this darkness
Between us, and the possum said nothing and ran on
Into the darkness, into the chasm and fell speaking of
The end of touch, the desire to forget desire, shadows,
The fear in a handful of dust, a woman’s mouth,
Fear I had known of and visited though now I cringed
At the thought of that violence, the violence that I brought —
And so thought to throw myself, too, in that chasm
When a hand touched my shoulder, a voice said, “Not now,
Maybe never. On we go, dear boy, through this weather.
Let’s find us another theory of light. Or darkness.”
Then, she laughed, for it was a woman with a lit darkness
And a careful chin, glasses, her body a tin of tender.
What do you know of me, I asked. She said, “Louis,
I know of you as I know fog — that it comes on
Through the alleys and past the dead boys and girls
Who had not wanted to die in those alleys and ornament
The city’s sight. Louis,” she said. “I’ve known all your light.

But do you know mine?” And I hadn’t, I hadn’t.
“I was a taken city burning,” she said, “a burning house
Built to heal the sick, a sick house full of healing,
The owl, moccasin, and panther — a rising
For which there has never been such risen, the total
Black. I is the total black. Flame and fox and knot
Of the what-nots you would have forgotten if not for me,
I am perfect fucking memory, no-dominion-defied,
The god-head-glitter-gussied-up-for-the-going-down.”
And though I thought I saw I had not seen. Instead
Of one body, three. Women. And who and who and who,
I asked. They laughed at my asking and said, “You
Wouldn’t know us, but we will tell you our names —
Mother, Song, and Holy Yoke. Audre, Gwendolyn,
And Lucille. Follow us. Or heel.” And where
And where should I follow you? They did not answer,
Instead, they walked on the edge of the abyss
Laughing as if the abyss. “We are what is whatnot,
The ever shimmying out of the never-wound.
Louis, do you follow or do you fall,”
They said. “Are you short or is you tall?”

And on and on they played, pleasured, and pigeoned
With each other, kiting sound and word between them
As I have seen lovers do, passing cigarettes and smoke
From one mouth to another, the smoke the shared body
Of a God that has no master or mastering plan
Other than abiding in darkness, abiding in both
Its coronation and crucifixion. On and on we walked.
And I followed. Beyond the bears chortling pears
From Augustine’s outstretched hand, out beyond the river
Scissoring the changing maple, its leaves ambering
Then auburn then green each time a child appeared
And touched its trunk. We stopped, watched. I asked
Who are they. And the one full of light and knives answered,
Waving at a few who journeyed to the edge of the water
But did not wade in. And why don’t they wade in,
I asked. She snickered, quieted, then said,
“Wind and foxes, what was never mine but was and was.”
As if she knew I did not understand, continued, “‘The ones
I got but did not get,’ the wild hair they could not grow
But scratches me now as it did once in a dream.
Our abortions, Louis, our ones given and gave. Dem.

The ones given all of their years at once. And none
Or never.” And when she spoke, I saw another come
To the shore and wave at me, a boy given and gave, the crushed-
Color of late evening long after the pickers have come
In and settled near a pot of ox bones boiling in the evening
Of their own water, once again predicting the arch
And strange astronomy of the flesh and its march march
March to October and the battered soil. I mean I turned
From the one waving because I could not be beneath
The stairs of his steering and stare. Paradise,
Why do you bring me to such weather? Why
Would any man come down from his noose for this?
“Because coming down is exactly the point.
All heavens lesser and below heaven. Noose, not ...
You came to see what has become of death ...    ”
The women spoke as one who had many tongues —
All Holy Ghost and gut of a river gabbling over the white
Stones. And where are we going, I asked.
“Where language begins, Till.
Paradise. But over there.”

And wasn’t this paradise that I had entered
Through the thick marsh waters out of the cane
The crowds fleeced of their living flesh at the far bank
The intubated children with their gas masks
Hanging from their hands and wandering
The sand in wet hospital gowns in this their new cancer
Wasn’t this paradise
A boy headphoned and heart drunk
Swaying at the back of the crowd mumbling to himself
Started from the bottom now we’re here
Started from the bottom now my whole team is fucking here
Wasn’t this paradise
The pigeons and finches flying back out
Of  the pane-glassed windows they crashed through
The glass behind them opening and closing
Like some never and wound
Diastole systole the valve collapsing
In its own beating sickness                   wasn’t this paradise
The rows and rows of men on horseback
The gnashing of  hoof in the heather
Everything ready to gallop or be galloped
Except the men and women herded
Into some queer parliament                  wasn’t this paradise
To refuse to run at the behest of some horsemen
The running           how we arrived here         wasn’t this
Paradise the end of running

“Wasn’t this paradise,” asked a man
Named Priam, a fence post cutting his head
Into two hemispheres, his mutilations and wounds
Closing, his two torn ears fluttering
Upwards from a sack hanging from a horseman’s white
Mare. “I was born with water in my voice,
The problem of a fouled well, the Lord
Gives us many, and I am the many given
But he, even as he gives, does not give a given to take
Or a given permitted to take. You see,”
And Priam stretched his hand over the people,
“We were a given taken and taken as a given.
I mean we are a transgressed light, a transgressed
People. We’ve been given this death. And now
You want us to take another death, but a man
Or woman can only take their one death.
And we have taken, we have taken, we have
Taken.” With each “taken” he pointed to the many,
To the boy with headphones who could be heard
Singing “Started from the bottom now we’re here,”
To Demby to Aunt Hester to Sandra Bland,

To Freddie Gray to Walter Scott to Eric Garner,
His throat still crushed in his one hand
Though in his other, a clutch of dry seeds
And wherever he stepped a patch of trees sprouted.
“Guides,” I asked, “where have I entered?” The names
Of the dead rolled out along the field; the whole
Field was counted — every maple, mango, muscadine,
Larkspur, ant, vine, and moss — and there was no
Answer from my guides. They stood beyond
The queer parliament of the dead, and so I rushed over
But could not make it to their portion of the field,
The edge disappearing, the banks moving back from me.
“We are not permitted,” they said. “We are not
The dead of this dead. A different light. But go.”
And then I heard my name; well, not my name
But the name of my name, “Till, Till, Till.”
And the men on the horses brought a boy up,
His hands tied, and one spoke, “It is a god
Who has given us this rest, this after and land,
This mount and tarry for the good works
Of our living. Why should we reject our peace?

No harm lasts; we live forever in our wounds.”
The man pulled his burgundy riding coat
To the side and blood ran waterfall from his ribs,
Onto his white britches. “And maybe,” a woman
Spoke, “your wounds would close if you would let ours,”
“But I am content in my wounds,” he said
And closed his riding robe though the blood labored
And labored. “I am content in my wounds.
Maybe we’ve been given to you to teach
You how to be content in yours,” he said.
“Such is given, such is given of God,
of a god.” The rider laughed and threw his head
Backward and there a wound, too, where his neck
Coupled with the skull, and the wound spoke
But not the speech of  the mouth but the speech of reason,
But not the reason of  Plato, Virgil, Foucault,
Or the stars maddening the night with their bursts
Of  madness, their dying in the night’s hair,
But the reason of the spear that pierces
The skull and slides through the chin, letting
The darkness down, letting all the darkness down.

“I see no God here nor one to come. Let down,
Let down from your mount and execution
Garden. You are no Nebuchadnezzar.
But if you keep up this reckless lord
And master, I will show you what beast
You are from the inside out, give the leaves
And spears of grass below a winter washing
In your love.” The men on mounts shook
Their reins and laughed. “And who are you,”
They asked. “The perfection of water,”
She answered. “The perfection of water.”
The mounted man with blood running from his skull,
Shook the rope holding the neck of the boy, Till.
“Well,” he said, “call me the perfection
Of slaughter. Teacher. Farmer. Daughter, move,
I will till this after and life and land
With whatever blade I choose, given or not.
Have you misunderstood dominion — or me?”
“I have and I have not,” she said. “I am
Not your daughter. I am Oya,
The mother of your slaughter. The mother

Of this order.” The woman, Oya, bent down, touched
The dry clods of soil. “Here, here is your god.”
She held up the dirt to the noses
Of the white horses. And water began falling
From the sky. “I will show you how to touch
The earth. I will show you how to die.

It would be winter, with a thin snow. An aged sunbeam would fall on me, then on a nearby summit, until a mass of ice would come upon me like a crown of master diamonds in shades of gold and pink. The base of the mountains would be still in darkness. The snow would melt, making the mountain uglier. The ice would undertake a journey toward dying. My iliacus, from which orchids bloom, would learn to take an infant’s shape, some premature creature weaned too soon. My femoral nerve, from which lichen grows in many shades, would learn to take breaths of its own and would issue a moan so labored it could have issued from two women carrying a full-length wooden casket, with dirt made from a girl inside. The dirt would have been buried with all of the girl’s celestial possessions. Bearing the casket would demand more muscles than earthbound horses have. The girl would have been twenty-four. This was my visio. Sometimes I think of it as prophecy. Other times, history. For years it was akin to some specific land, with a vessel that would come for me, able to cross land, sea, the spaces of the universe, able to burrow deep into the ground. Anything could summon it — a breaking in cloud cover, wind chimes catching salt outside my mother’s window, a corner of a painting. And I learned how to call it, too. This is the only skill of which I have ever been proud. When my sister died, from the head of my visio came offspring in the thousands, armed to the teeth, each its own vessel. My first, their mother, lived on. For itself and its hoard it found a permanent home in a cave at the bottom of a lake. And it waited until I was standing on a mountain to sing to me:You will call this mountain home until I tell you to move again. There will always be more of it underground than youwill ever see with your eye. And so it turned out to be true. And so when I stood on the mountain that became my home, I beheld a dirt sea, and saw our moon, which has two faces. I learned that one face of our moon is dappled with maria, and that the sunbeams here are newborns that lie on each other, purpling into the fog and outstretched pines. The Earth spins masses of air until it looks like one of many irises studding our galaxy. From space, parts of the Atlantic look like leather, wrinkled and dark, and others look like iridescent fishes in an old Master’s painting of the sky. I live in the valley of a crater here, where steam rises like ghosts in the summer heat. This mountain is made of igneous stone. Every day I issue a warning to lovers: darlings, I have in my possession a dead girl deer. Her head is draped over my right shoulder. I hold her with one arm encircling her torso. You wake each morning with flowers shrouding your body, like a corpse; I put them there. To me, you died when my legs curved around your head. One of the deer’s eyes has blackened, and her tongue is thick. She belonged to my sister. O my sister, you were twenty-four. Listen close. Even to this part. Especially this. I want you to hear what I say to lovers, because I want to sing to you, who died a virgin, a few treatises on love and sex —  how flesh and ecstasy are born, what they make, how they live out their days. As a bodied girl you feared me, and I met your fear with guttural disdain. I imagine you wondered what it would take for me to hear a mortal, human voice: whenever you spoke, a vessel came for me, chattering like some frail and hissing bird, pigeon-chested, thin-veined feet. Sister, I don’t listen to lovers, either, who I call by the same names that were yours:dear, beloved. But spirits are not like their progenitors. Their touches can range, texturally, from velvet to bristle. Lover, each time I kiss you I name after you a sickly feeling in my own body, as if each ailing is a previously undiscovered moon orbiting a planet that can only sustain the strangest of life-forms. Sister, I know neither goodness nor mercy shall follow me all the days of my life, as surely that I know the beasts I inherit or create, of all unions familial or otherwise, are speechless and brute, and bound to die soon. Yes, there is much to love about the body. Too, there is much to hate. I cast off care for pleasure, and for labor, teaching my body over time that these things can’t coexist. I fear it has started to believe me. My body has never sought wholeness the way yours did, sister. It was always still the dull twilight of early morning with us. You were twenty-four, and when you died, I stopped fearing arson. When I picture us as girls, we are at the base of the mountain from my visio, divining the summit as we diminish into spots of light. We are without parentage. On my mountaintop in midafternoons flocks of wheeling birds gather around the crescent moon. When the moon worms its way through the clouds, it fixes its eyes on me and sings a song that says we live our lives chained to earth, and that when we die the flesh falls off our bones so our bones can turn into the driest of riverbed dirt. Sister, when you died, your bones cast an enchantment. We made a powder of them, and I named the powder ash, because ash is a word with neither origin nor afterlife, and its definition is the look a doe gets when she’s been away from her herd too long. When a person goes missing and we don’t know her name, we grant her the surname Doe. With this christening we name all missing persons part of the family of ash, which has no family. Sometimes I think that each speck of ash previously named Priya hums on quiet nights in a frequency only the other pieces can hear. Inaudible to the waking world she hums to herself. That hum is how my blood became blue; in lieu of oxygen, my body began to breathe in only the vibrations of the hum. Blood has to be born into its colors. Or, more precisely, it has to die into them. In Hesiod’s Theogony, Nyx is born of Chaos. Erebus, Gaia, and Tartarus are her siblings. Hesiod couldn’t decide whether Nyx birthed the Fates or whether the Fates were born of someone else, but he knew that Nyx’s children, whoever they were, had no sire. About Nyx’s brothers and sisters, Hesiod writes: Earth too, and great Oceanus, and dark Night, the holy race of all the other deathless ones that are for ever, and one day — what? Tell me. Tell me the song they taught you. Tell me how you learned how beautiful Nyx is, how you realized Zeus feared her, and how you first saw that within her every star, from the swollen to the hollow, from the living to the dead, is visible, powered by little but her peerless face. When I returned north for the first time since my father turned my sister into a powder named ash, a word born of nothing and with no children, I heard her from a seagull on the ferry I rode from the harbor to the Cape, out of a piping plover on the dunes, in a crow’s call on the highway from Boston to Gloucester, past Folly’s Cove, Prides Crossing, Rust Island. Then, from my station again on the mountain, I heard my own voice from a brown thrasher. That night I drove through remains of a fresh accident on the mountain highway. The dropping sun lit my back as if heralding fire. A dislocated red front bumper straddled the median, singing a song. Nyx was in the wind, and her siblings, and they bade me sing, too, like Hesiod had asked. Grant lovely song, celebrate the holy race of the deathless gods who are for ever, born of Earth and starry Heaven and gloomy Night and them that briny Sea did rear. Soon all were singing. The median sang with the deep voice of a woman who knows how to sing scat, and the mountain, standing like a moon on earth, responded with a wordless song of its own creation. Ash sang. Dirt sang. To them I lent a melody, which is one of the things I do when I can’t sleep. The secret about lullabies: when they work, it’s because they sound like something plants would sing in Hades, on the banks  of the river dark. Oh how I wish they worked on me. When the sculptor couldn’t sleep, she drew mountains. They were pink, red, ridged and pulsing, and rose from valleys of blue. Or else she’d draw eyes that held too many irises, or wombs that bore sweet cysts, or spindle-legged women with outsized, drooping breasts, ill-formed and misshapen eyes for nipples, uneven halos for areolae, made of the same skin as the kind under eyes that have been open for too long. Those songs I sing when I can’t sleep are directed to my army of visios. In return, they give me images of myself as different creatures: gibbons, a chicken with a plucked-feather neck, an asteroid, a mountain, a volcano with the thinnest, most translucent shell. Me, as some fantastical beast with eyes lining the inside of my body, watching my diaphragm turn into the ocean I saw from the ferry, watching plumes of sun flare over it as it comes to resemble a dead animal’s long-weathered skin. Ghostly ships with dropped anchors materialize to trawl it, and squadrons of men dismount, searching for new blooms in terra mountainous and lush. My heart is a sky embalmed and bright. When the phantoms drop anchor, there to welcome their sailors are screaming pelicans on the rocks, and parades continually wheeling of ugly vultures in funereal garb. In their eyes, the Atlantic always looks besieged by hurricane. Lunar maria means moon seas, but when I hear it I picture horses, torqued female beasts who live on the moon and whose manes are made of the roots of moon-trees. I did not want to die, but I wanted to want death. None of you ever knew how badly. I have practiced at it. At times I rehearsed like a dancer, surrounded by mirrored walls. At others I moonlighted with movies set on battlefields and abattoirs, pausing and rewinding until I could mimic the motions of actresses who succumb to unexpected poison, or shove knives into their bellies, or fall like Brueghel’s boy. I pretended I was standing in a castle dressed like a samurai, looking through a barred window, knowing the trees approaching held a promise so annihilative my flesh would have no choice but to accept. I pictured jumping from the top of the mountain and I sang Love it Love it Love it. On my mountain the birds shroud the pines, and the pines make a spectral outline against the valley of Nyx’s body. One afternoon here a man said to his son: All this has to do with eons of time, water over and over, just cutting and cutting the rock. From where I stand on its summit, I can touch the Big Dipper and I can see its children, and another peak, shaped like the back of a horse. It is shadow blue, the same blue as the dying sky. To the Big Dipper and her children I sing a song that asks if they are safe, and tells them that on forest floors, dappled things of glass and light grow from knotted roots. Sister, could I find you on that horse mountain? I wonder if I want to. Have I made this world? Lover, a confession. If I found my sister on any mountain, I would gather her in my arms and take her from its back, singing lullabies. Or else I’d take an arrow laced with a drug I’d made special for her, and, standing close, push it in her unarmed right flank. Instead of how to die, I ended up studying how to kill. But the sculptor, she asked nothing of her dead. Out of visions of them she made formidable metal spiders she named Maman, Maman, Maman. Maman Maman Maman, who live after the sculptor has died, have all lost children, like my mother. Their domains are terrors — land-terrors, water-terrors, terrors of the open sky. Their hearts are war- grief. Terrors of trees in the joyless forest, of portent. Sometimes in their homes are fires on floods, dire wonders. Their children were all named Doe, which means that the plural form for children of Maman is deer. For a long time I hated the phrase I am sorry for your loss. I lost nothing. My sister died. But loss is less of a euphemism than its users want;to lose means both to have been defeated and to misplace.Maman Maman Maman also answers to Demeter Demeter Demeter. Sister, I could stop no one from taking your head, although I promise you I fought for it, hand-to-hand by the mouth of the bone-house. One day on my mountain, I got to thinking about those other peaks. From a cave underwater I heard: Find them, like flowers strange and never before seen. And so it became true. I found mountains covered in smoke-thick fogs, and mountains that lied — those were barely hills. And then I found them: what the mountains in my visio would have looked like had it been summer in that land. Summer brought some changes: my body had no orchids or lichen, and the crown was not of diamonds, but the reek of sewage, wafting over a field — a prairie almost —  from which rose tens of signal towers, all blinking red. The base of mountains was, when I got there, still, and in darkness. It was a sky in which every child of every star, living or dead, could be heard humming. The peerless face of the mountain was cragged rock, dust rock, shadow rock. I stayed until day, to watch the birth of a sunbeam so I could then see it age. Later in the day an immense heat came, like another bone-house. I climbed the ridges, which turned to colored ringlets of cloud and ash at the slightest pressure. Sunrise and sunset were scant minutes of shadow-play. The prairie grass’s rustle, each blade sang in a different language. There I learned the names of four of the lunar mares: Catfire, Osiris, Blood Oath, and Early Morning. This is who I am. I harbor secret loves, and I do secret work. Catfire, Osiris, Blood Oath, and Early Morning are teaching me how to finally chart a course through time, how to carve journeys in space: they descended from their moon to the crags, followed me home to my moonlike mountain. Lover, my body —  you won’t be able to keep up with it. Soon you’ll have to leave it. You’ll have to leave me. Or else I’ll leave you, because my body, it invents definitions for the word sadness, like noun, the feathers on a bird’s back. You’ll do nothing for me. On my mountain, it’s midafternoon, and the wheeling birds are landing steadily, even though no stable ground is here to be found. When they sing, it is a song that I, who know no prayers, imagine to be gospel. A man comes up the mountainside and sings along with them as he walks in circles on the rock. Robbed, sister, was your breath. Robbed, lover, is yours, too. Sister, I wish you could know this feeling: if sung perfectly, pressure on each nerve cluster can make bones irrelevant, whether those bones are living or dead, whether they are ash or dirt. At the base of my mountain is a lake where creatures go to die. Water slides into their spiracles and fills their tracheae. Their tracheae stretch into bellows fit to extinguish the fires in any volcano. When my body showed me sadness and began there to outline and diagram the word, another definition was noun, a chorus of brass instruments,like upward-turned mouths forged of metal, and another was verb,to shake like chimes flanking a rock-hewn shore, barely alive and almost imperceptible for a flash. Sometimes I picture my sister underneath one of the sculptor’s spiders. Her head barely reaches the first joint on the spider’s leg, and when she looks up, she thinks that the whole sky is the spider’s stomach. Maman, she says, I am hungry.Food. Food. I am hungry. She runs her shrunken finger from one tagma to another. Her stroke makes lava run faster in all the volcanoes within the tectonic plate on which she lives, and she, unawares, suckles at every ridge she can find. She rests both palms flat against the metal, closes her eyes and cries. What would the world look like with enough lava to fill the Atlantic? I know that the Earth’s temperature has risen, and I know that all of its ice will melt. I know there will be no more purple from the sun, that the spider’s iron underside is one of the few things that, like my mother, does not sing. At the lake today is a flock of feral cats. Though they’re in front of me, their song comes from below, so although I can see them, I picture them swimming in a river that separates mortals from the planet’s heart. In this river floats the phantom of a dead doe. Listen to me now, darlings: my sister did not live long enough to see the moon turn red, but I did, and despite those who wish otherwise, myself included, I will see it again. Sadness’s fourth definition is conjunction, bees, forests of them, devotional and thick enoughto knot together human dreams, or human bodies, even when ghostly,or lovelorn. The underground river gives me no passage, despite my dreams of the phantom that dropped anchor somewhere, and of its amassed pelicans and vultures. Each ghost is filled to the brim with flowers whose scents describe the places they were born, just like mine does, no matter how hard I try to cloak it. On the top of my mountain a man says to a woman: I like how there’s just trees. Trees trees trees, she replies. Each time she says the word, her voice makes a new species. I recently tried another way to die: could I fall from a tower filled wall-to-wall with twenty-four thousand living flowers, each planted in the soil covering the tower’s floors, six inches deep? The flowers would have heavy-branched spikes for blooms, and would release a powerful smell of bone marrow, and spew a pollen that fills the air until it becomes oppressive. When I opened my mouth to sing of this, instead of a sound my mouth expelled gnats and fog, which is what a spider’s milk is made of. The word Nyx tastes like sister and means both night and flower. I worry I won’t rest again. Do you know how a naked Titan looks, sister? He’s swarmed with shadow, but he holds light deep in his stomach, like an electric secret. Dear love, I can’t give you what you need from me. All I’ll do is take. After my sister died, I learned she always wanted a warm island, garlands draped around her neck. There was no mountain in her vision. Instead, in it she was singing what she imagined was an island song in a language I don’t know. She was dancing badly, and breathing with great labor on burnished sands. Sand bores me, sister; I need rock and high altitude. When I am cold, I hear wolves. I think they live in the carillon beside the mountain’s lake. Sister, it was always true that I would outlive you. I know exactly how many times my family wished me dead. Don’t look up, says a child on the top of my mountain. It makes you want to fall. It will always be still the dull twilight of early morning with us. This is one of the curses of living. In the end, my visio alone will sing and dance, breathing heavily. Every day the sunbeams in it turn a brighter pink. Dears. Beloveds. All of you. Your blood is bewitched, and bade to move into places it wasn’t meant to go, steeped deeply in poisons it can’t purge. You share the look on your face with all the others, whether deer, child, or man. If you look deeply enough into any other pair of eyes, your heart valves start to change allegiances. Your body’s lakes fill with the other’s want, until all you want, in turn, is what the other wants, which rises in you like seawater. There are species of flowers and invasive weeds that live only in another’s gaze, whether lovelorn, hate-filled, hopeless, or hungry. I am looking into your eyes right now, and in my mind are two girl deer. Sisters. With thin-hooved legs steady, digging into grass. They disappear into the woods, which are part of a forest in a painting. When the novelist saw this painting, he thought that there he could see men turning into birds and birds turning into men, and those same men turning then into sea creatures, and then back into birds. From this final change scales and tentacles would linger on their backs as they wheeled through the air, as would the dream of filling their lungs with the sea, for which they would ache. The definition of deer is lost. The definition of beloved is dissolution. On the top of my mountain I hear a mother call to a faceless child, Where are you? The chattering and thin voice of a boy from the top of a tree cries back,In the woods. And then, beguilingly: Come into the woods. Around the orbs of light in the forest that I still don’t know if the Dipper’s children can see, new trees grow beside the pines: elms, birches, willows, one strange Western juniper. Each creature in this forest was once something, or someone, else —  the novelist was right. The top of one of the elms is a sprig of radiant blood. Sister, I was very young when I found out you were cloven-hooved. I did what I could. I want to say that you can trust me, that I am listening to you, and that you can speak to me and that I will speak to you at last. Tell me about the beasts that got you. The beasts who carry me when I am too weak to carry my deer alone are Catfire, Osiris, Blood Oath, and Early Morning. I would like to believe that I carry this deer for you, that I’ll be able to tell you what it feels like to have a hungry mouth on your lip or nipple. I want to say:Sister, I promise. But the definition of myth is noun,the idea that any one creature can ever hear another. And while I beguile you to betray yourself to me, like lovers do in their sleep, I am lying to you. No, death did not bring this to us. It has always been true. I, sister, am a selfish woman, and you, sister, were a mute one. My body invents words and swells with prophecies. Its effort shows in insect bites and rashes that don’t heal, in my peeled hands, bleeding groin, wistful gut, misaligned jaw, mole-like left eye, lump-riddled womb. Dears. Beloveds. You’ve been asleep a long time, but we all return to the waking world someday. And when you do at last come back, you will find me spent and alone, ugly, wounded, ungrateful, ill. Shaking and calling to you for aid. Loveless. Without a soul or even the memory of pleasure. The last lover to desert me will deem me rancid. The last thing I hear my sister’s voice from will be dirt. Of the mares I will have left only Early Morning, who won’t know that I will soon take her hide, turn it into an ocean that will, at last, cleave open my skull.

Other times, history. For years it was akin to some specific land, with a vessel that would come for me, able to cross land, sea, the spaces of the universe, able to burrow deep into the ground. Anything could summon it — a breaking in cloud cover, wind chimes catching salt outside my mother’s window, a corner of a painting. And I learned how to call it, too. This is the only skill of which I have ever been proud. When my sister died, from the head of my visio came offspring in the thousands, armed to the teeth, each its own vessel. My first, their mother, lived on. For itself and its hoard it found a permanent home in a cave at the bottom of a lake. And it waited until I was standing on a mountain to sing to me:You will call this mountain home until I tell you to move again. There will always be more of it underground than youwill ever see with your eye. And so it turned out to be true. And so when I stood on the mountain that became my home, I beheld a dirt sea, and saw our moon, which has two faces. I learned that one face of our moon is dappled with maria, and that the sunbeams here are newborns that lie on each other, purpling into the fog and outstretched pines. The Earth spins masses of air until it looks like one of many irises studding our galaxy. From space, parts of the Atlantic look like leather, wrinkled and dark, and others look like iridescent fishes in an old Master’s painting of the sky. I live in the valley of a crater here, where steam rises like ghosts in the summer heat. This mountain is made of igneous stone. Every day I issue a warning to lovers: darlings, I have in my possession a dead girl deer. Her head is draped over my right shoulder. I hold her with one arm encircling her torso. You wake each morning with flowers shrouding your body, like a corpse; I put them there. To me, you died when my legs curved around your head. One of the deer’s eyes has blackened, and her tongue is thick. She belonged to my sister. O my sister, you were twenty-four. Listen close. Even to this part. Especially this. I want you to hear what I say to lovers, because I want to sing to you, who died a virgin, a few treatises on love and sex —  how flesh and ecstasy are born, what they make, how they live out their days. As a bodied girl you feared me, and I met your fear with guttural disdain. I imagine you wondered what it would take for me to hear a mortal, human voice: whenever you spoke, a vessel came for me, chattering like some frail and hissing bird, pigeon-chested, thin-veined feet. Sister, I don’t listen to lovers, either, who I call by the same names that were yours:dear, beloved. But spirits are not like their progenitors. Their touches can range, texturally, from velvet to bristle. Lover, each time I kiss you I name after you a sickly feeling in my own body, as if each ailing is a previously undiscovered moon orbiting a planet that can only sustain the strangest of life-forms. Sister, I know neither goodness nor mercy shall follow me all the days of my life, as surely that I know the beasts I inherit or create, of all unions familial or otherwise, are speechless and brute, and bound to die soon. Yes, there is much to love about the body. Too, there is much to hate. I cast off care for pleasure, and for labor, teaching my body over time that these things can’t coexist. I fear it has started to believe me. My body has never sought wholeness the way yours did, sister. It was always still the dull twilight of early morning with us. You were twenty-four, and when you died, I stopped fearing arson. When I picture us as girls, we are at the base of the mountain from my visio, divining the summit as we diminish into spots of light. We are without parentage. On my mountaintop in midafternoons flocks of wheeling birds gather around the crescent moon. When the moon worms its way through the clouds, it fixes its eyes on me and sings a song that says we live our lives chained to earth, and that when we die the flesh falls off our bones so our bones can turn into the driest of riverbed dirt. Sister, when you died, your bones cast an enchantment. We made a powder of them, and I named the powder ash, because ash is a word with neither origin nor afterlife, and its definition is the look a doe gets when she’s been away from her herd too long. When a person goes missing and we don’t know her name, we grant her the surname Doe. With this christening we name all missing persons part of the family of ash, which has no family. Sometimes I think that each speck of ash previously named Priya hums on quiet nights in a frequency only the other pieces can hear. Inaudible to the waking world she hums to herself. That hum is how my blood became blue; in lieu of oxygen, my body began to breathe in only the vibrations of the hum. Blood has to be born into its colors. Or, more precisely, it has to die into them. In Hesiod’s Theogony, Nyx is born of Chaos. Erebus, Gaia, and Tartarus are her siblings. Hesiod couldn’t decide whether Nyx birthed the Fates or whether the Fates were born of someone else, but he knew that Nyx’s children, whoever they were, had no sire. About Nyx’s brothers and sisters, Hesiod writes: Earth too, and great Oceanus, and dark Night, the holy race of all the other deathless ones that are for ever, and one day — what? Tell me. Tell me the song they taught you. Tell me how you learned how beautiful Nyx is, how you realized Zeus feared her, and how you first saw that within her every star, from the swollen to the hollow, from the living to the dead, is visible, powered by little but her peerless face. When I returned north for the first time since my father turned my sister into a powder named ash, a word born of nothing and with no children, I heard her from a seagull on the ferry I rode from the harbor to the Cape, out of a piping plover on the dunes, in a crow’s call on the highway from Boston to Gloucester, past Folly’s Cove, Prides Crossing, Rust Island. Then, from my station again on the mountain, I heard my own voice from a brown thrasher. That night I drove through remains of a fresh accident on the mountain highway. The dropping sun lit my back as if heralding fire. A dislocated red front bumper straddled the median, singing a song. Nyx was in the wind, and her siblings, and they bade me sing, too, like Hesiod had asked. Grant lovely song, celebrate the holy race of the deathless gods who are for ever, born of Earth and starry Heaven and gloomy Night and them that briny Sea did rear. Soon all were singing. The median sang with the deep voice of a woman who knows how to sing scat, and the mountain, standing like a moon on earth, responded with a wordless song of its own creation. Ash sang. Dirt sang. To them I lent a melody, which is one of the things I do when I can’t sleep. The secret about lullabies: when they work, it’s because they sound like something plants would sing in Hades, on the banks  of the river dark. Oh how I wish they worked on me. When the sculptor couldn’t sleep, she drew mountains. They were pink, red, ridged and pulsing, and rose from valleys of blue. Or else she’d draw eyes that held too many irises, or wombs that bore sweet cysts, or spindle-legged women with outsized, drooping breasts, ill-formed and misshapen eyes for nipples, uneven halos for areolae, made of the same skin as the kind under eyes that have been open for too long. Those songs I sing when I can’t sleep are directed to my army of visios. In return, they give me images of myself as different creatures: gibbons, a chicken with a plucked-feather neck, an asteroid, a mountain, a volcano with the thinnest, most translucent shell. Me, as some fantastical beast with eyes lining the inside of my body, watching my diaphragm turn into the ocean I saw from the ferry, watching plumes of sun flare over it as it comes to resemble a dead animal’s long-weathered skin. Ghostly ships with dropped anchors materialize to trawl it, and squadrons of men dismount, searching for new blooms in terra mountainous and lush. My heart is a sky embalmed and bright. When the phantoms drop anchor, there to welcome their sailors are screaming pelicans on the rocks, and parades continually wheeling of ugly vultures in funereal garb. In their eyes, the Atlantic always looks besieged by hurricane. Lunar maria means moon seas, but when I hear it I picture horses, torqued female beasts who live on the moon and whose manes are made of the roots of moon-trees. I did not want to die, but I wanted to want death. None of you ever knew how badly. I have practiced at it. At times I rehearsed like a dancer, surrounded by mirrored walls. At others I moonlighted with movies set on battlefields and abattoirs, pausing and rewinding until I could mimic the motions of actresses who succumb to unexpected poison, or shove knives into their bellies, or fall like Brueghel’s boy. I pretended I was standing in a castle dressed like a samurai, looking through a barred window, knowing the trees approaching held a promise so annihilative my flesh would have no choice but to accept. I pictured jumping from the top of the mountain and I sang Love it Love it Love it. On my mountain the birds shroud the pines, and the pines make a spectral outline against the valley of Nyx’s body. One afternoon here a man said to his son: All this has to do with eons of time, water over and over, just cutting and cutting the rock. From where I stand on its summit, I can touch the Big Dipper and I can see its children, and another peak, shaped like the back of a horse. It is shadow blue, the same blue as the dying sky. To the Big Dipper and her children I sing a song that asks if they are safe, and tells them that on forest floors, dappled things of glass and light grow from knotted roots. Sister, could I find you on that horse mountain? I wonder if I want to. Have I made this world? Lover, a confession. If I found my sister on any mountain, I would gather her in my arms and take her from its back, singing lullabies. Or else I’d take an arrow laced with a drug I’d made special for her, and, standing close, push it in her unarmed right flank. Instead of how to die, I ended up studying how to kill. But the sculptor, she asked nothing of her dead. Out of visions of them she made formidable metal spiders she named Maman, Maman, Maman. Maman Maman Maman, who live after the sculptor has died, have all lost children, like my mother. Their domains are terrors — land-terrors, water-terrors, terrors of the open sky. Their hearts are war- grief. Terrors of trees in the joyless forest, of portent. Sometimes in their homes are fires on floods, dire wonders. Their children were all named Doe, which means that the plural form for children of Maman is deer. For a long time I hated the phrase I am sorry for your loss. I lost nothing. My sister died. But loss is less of a euphemism than its users want;to lose means both to have been defeated and to misplace.Maman Maman Maman also answers to Demeter Demeter Demeter. Sister, I could stop no one from taking your head, although I promise you I fought for it, hand-to-hand by the mouth of the bone-house. One day on my mountain, I got to thinking about those other peaks. From a cave underwater I heard: Find them, like flowers strange and never before seen. And so it became true. I found mountains covered in smoke-thick fogs, and mountains that lied — those were barely hills. And then I found them: what the mountains in my visio would have looked like had it been summer in that land. Summer brought some changes: my body had no orchids or lichen, and the crown was not of diamonds, but the reek of sewage, wafting over a field — a prairie almost —  from which rose tens of signal towers, all blinking red. The base of mountains was, when I got there, still, and in darkness. It was a sky in which every child of every star, living or dead, could be heard humming. The peerless face of the mountain was cragged rock, dust rock, shadow rock. I stayed until day, to watch the birth of a sunbeam so I could then see it age. Later in the day an immense heat came, like another bone-house. I climbed the ridges, which turned to colored ringlets of cloud and ash at the slightest pressure. Sunrise and sunset were scant minutes of shadow-play. The prairie grass’s rustle, each blade sang in a different language. There I learned the names of four of the lunar mares: Catfire, Osiris, Blood Oath, and Early Morning. This is who I am. I harbor secret loves, and I do secret work. Catfire, Osiris, Blood Oath, and Early Morning are teaching me how to finally chart a course through time, how to carve journeys in space: they descended from their moon to the crags, followed me home to my moonlike mountain. Lover, my body —  you won’t be able to keep up with it. Soon you’ll have to leave it. You’ll have to leave me. Or else I’ll leave you, because my body, it invents definitions for the word sadness, like noun, the feathers on a bird’s back. You’ll do nothing for me. On my mountain, it’s midafternoon, and the wheeling birds are landing steadily, even though no stable ground is here to be found. When they sing, it is a song that I, who know no prayers, imagine to be gospel. A man comes up the mountainside and sings along with them as he walks in circles on the rock. Robbed, sister, was your breath. Robbed, lover, is yours, too. Sister, I wish you could know this feeling: if sung perfectly, pressure on each nerve cluster can make bones irrelevant, whether those bones are living or dead, whether they are ash or dirt. At the base of my mountain is a lake where creatures go to die. Water slides into their spiracles and fills their tracheae. Their tracheae stretch into bellows fit to extinguish the fires in any volcano. When my body showed me sadness and began there to outline and diagram the word, another definition was noun, a chorus of brass instruments,like upward-turned mouths forged of metal, and another was verb,to shake like chimes flanking a rock-hewn shore, barely alive and almost imperceptible for a flash. Sometimes I picture my sister underneath one of the sculptor’s spiders. Her head barely reaches the first joint on the spider’s leg, and when she looks up, she thinks that the whole sky is the spider’s stomach. Maman, she says, I am hungry.Food. Food. I am hungry. She runs her shrunken finger from one tagma to another. Her stroke makes lava run faster in all the volcanoes within the tectonic plate on which she lives, and she, unawares, suckles at every ridge she can find. She rests both palms flat against the metal, closes her eyes and cries. What would the world look like with enough lava to fill the Atlantic? I know that the Earth’s temperature has risen, and I know that all of its ice will melt. I know there will be no more purple from the sun, that the spider’s iron underside is one of the few things that, like my mother, does not sing. At the lake today is a flock of feral cats. Though they’re in front of me, their song comes from below, so although I can see them, I picture them swimming in a river that separates mortals from the planet’s heart. In this river floats the phantom of a dead doe. Listen to me now, darlings: my sister did not live long enough to see the moon turn red, but I did, and despite those who wish otherwise, myself included, I will see it again. Sadness’s fourth definition is conjunction, bees, forests of them, devotional and thick enoughto knot together human dreams, or human bodies, even when ghostly,or lovelorn. The underground river gives me no passage, despite my dreams of the phantom that dropped anchor somewhere, and of its amassed pelicans and vultures. Each ghost is filled to the brim with flowers whose scents describe the places they were born, just like mine does, no matter how hard I try to cloak it. On the top of my mountain a man says to a woman: I like how there’s just trees. Trees trees trees, she replies. Each time she says the word, her voice makes a new species. I recently tried another way to die: could I fall from a tower filled wall-to-wall with twenty-four thousand living flowers, each planted in the soil covering the tower’s floors, six inches deep? The flowers would have heavy-branched spikes for blooms, and would release a powerful smell of bone marrow, and spew a pollen that fills the air until it becomes oppressive. When I opened my mouth to sing of this, instead of a sound my mouth expelled gnats and fog, which is what a spider’s milk is made of. The word Nyx tastes like sister and means both night and flower. I worry I won’t rest again. Do you know how a naked Titan looks, sister? He’s swarmed with shadow, but he holds light deep in his stomach, like an electric secret. Dear love, I can’t give you what you need from me. All I’ll do is take. After my sister died, I learned she always wanted a warm island, garlands draped around her neck. There was no mountain in her vision. Instead, in it she was singing what she imagined was an island song in a language I don’t know. She was dancing badly, and breathing with great labor on burnished sands. Sand bores me, sister; I need rock and high altitude. When I am cold, I hear wolves. I think they live in the carillon beside the mountain’s lake. Sister, it was always true that I would outlive you. I know exactly how many times my family wished me dead. Don’t look up, says a child on the top of my mountain. It makes you want to fall. It will always be still the dull twilight of early morning with us. This is one of the curses of living. In the end, my visio alone will sing and dance, breathing heavily. Every day the sunbeams in it turn a brighter pink. Dears. Beloveds. All of you. Your blood is bewitched, and bade to move into places it wasn’t meant to go, steeped deeply in poisons it can’t purge. You share the look on your face with all the others, whether deer, child, or man. If you look deeply enough into any other pair of eyes, your heart valves start to change allegiances. Your body’s lakes fill with the other’s want, until all you want, in turn, is what the other wants, which rises in you like seawater. There are species of flowers and invasive weeds that live only in another’s gaze, whether lovelorn, hate-filled, hopeless, or hungry. I am looking into your eyes right now, and in my mind are two girl deer. Sisters. With thin-hooved legs steady, digging into grass. They disappear into the woods, which are part of a forest in a painting. When the novelist saw this painting, he thought that there he could see men turning into birds and birds turning into men, and those same men turning then into sea creatures, and then back into birds. From this final change scales and tentacles would linger on their backs as they wheeled through the air, as would the dream of filling their lungs with the sea, for which they would ache. The definition of deer is lost. The definition of beloved is dissolution. On the top of my mountain I hear a mother call to a faceless child, Where are you? The chattering and thin voice of a boy from the top of a tree cries back,In the woods. And then, beguilingly: Come into the woods. Around the orbs of light in the forest that I still don’t know if the Dipper’s children can see, new trees grow beside the pines: elms, birches, willows, one strange Western juniper. Each creature in this forest was once something, or someone, else —  the novelist was right. The top of one of the elms is a sprig of radiant blood. Sister, I was very young when I found out you were cloven-hooved. I did what I could. I want to say that you can trust me, that I am listening to you, and that you can speak to me and that I will speak to you at last. Tell me about the beasts that got you. The beasts who carry me when I am too weak to carry my deer alone are Catfire, Osiris, Blood Oath, and Early Morning. I would like to believe that I carry this deer for you, that I’ll be able to tell you what it feels like to have a hungry mouth on your lip or nipple. I want to say:Sister, I promise. But the definition of myth is noun,the idea that any one creature can ever hear another. And while I beguile you to betray yourself to me, like lovers do in their sleep, I am lying to you. No, death did not bring this to us. It has always been true. I, sister, am a selfish woman, and you, sister, were a mute one. My body invents words and swells with prophecies. Its effort shows in insect bites and rashes that don’t heal, in my peeled hands, bleeding groin, wistful gut, misaligned jaw, mole-like left eye, lump-riddled womb. Dears. Beloveds. You’ve been asleep a long time, but we all return to the waking world someday. And when you do at last come back, you will find me spent and alone, ugly, wounded, ungrateful, ill. Shaking and calling to you for aid. Loveless. Without a soul or even the memory of pleasure. The last lover to desert me will deem me rancid. The last thing I hear my sister’s voice from will be dirt. Of the mares I will have left only Early Morning, who won’t know that I will soon take her hide, turn it into an ocean that will, at last, cleave open my skull.

It would be winter, with a thin snow. An aged sunbeam
would fall on me, then on a nearby summit, until a mass
of ice would come upon me like a crown of master diamonds
in shades of gold and pink. The base of the mountains
would be still in darkness. The snow would melt,
making the mountain uglier. The ice would undertake
a journey toward dying. My iliacus, from which orchids bloom,
would learn to take an infant’s shape, some premature creature
weaned too soon. My femoral nerve, from which lichen grows
in many shades, would learn to take breaths of its own
and would issue a moan so labored it could have issued
from two women carrying a full-length wooden casket, with dirt
made from a girl inside. The dirt would have been buried
with all of the girl’s celestial possessions. Bearing the casket
would demand more muscles than earthbound horses have.
The girl would have been twenty-four. This was my visio.
Sometimes I think of it as prophecy. Other times, history.
For years it was akin to some specific land, with a vessel
that would come for me, able to cross land, sea, the spaces
of the universe, able to burrow deep into the ground.
Anything could summon it — a breaking in cloud cover,
wind chimes catching salt outside my mother’s window,
a corner of a painting. And I learned how to call it, too.
This is the only skill of which I have ever been proud.
When my sister died, from the head of my visio came offspring
in the thousands, armed to the teeth, each its own vessel.
My first, their mother, lived on. For itself and its hoard
it found a permanent home in a cave at the bottom of a lake.
And it waited until I was standing on a mountain to sing to me:
You will call this mountain home until I tell you to move again.
There will always be more of it underground than you
will ever see with your eye. And so it turned out to be true.
And so when I stood on the mountain that became my home,
I beheld a dirt sea, and saw our moon, which has two faces.
I learned that one face of our moon is dappled with maria,
and that the sunbeams here are newborns that lie
on each other, purpling into the fog and outstretched pines.
The Earth spins masses of air until it looks like one of many
irises studding our galaxy. From space, parts of the Atlantic
look like leather, wrinkled and dark, and others look
like iridescent fishes in an old Master’s painting of the sky.
I live in the valley of a crater here, where steam rises like ghosts
in the summer heat. This mountain is made of igneous stone.
Every day I issue a warning to lovers: darlings, I have
in my possession a dead girl deer. Her head is draped
over my right shoulder. I hold her with one arm
encircling her torso. You wake each morning with flowers
shrouding your body, like a corpse; I put them there.
To me, you died when my legs curved around your head.
One of the deer’s eyes has blackened, and her tongue is thick.
She belonged to my sister. O my sister, you were twenty-four.
Listen close. Even to this part. Especially this.
I want you to hear what I say to lovers, because I want to sing
to you, who died a virgin, a few treatises on love and sex —
how flesh and ecstasy are born, what they make,
how they live out their days. As a bodied girl
you feared me, and I met your fear with guttural disdain.
I imagine you wondered what it would take for me to hear
a mortal, human voice: whenever you spoke, a vessel came
for me, chattering like some frail and hissing bird,
pigeon-chested, thin-veined feet. Sister, I don’t listen to lovers,
either, who I call by the same names that were yours:
dear, beloved. But spirits are not like their progenitors.
Their touches can range, texturally, from velvet to bristle.
Lover, each time I kiss you I name after you
a sickly feeling in my own body, as if each ailing
is a previously undiscovered moon orbiting a planet
that can only sustain the strangest of life-forms.
Sister, I know neither goodness nor mercy shall follow me
all the days of my life, as surely that I know the beasts
I inherit or create, of all unions familial or otherwise,
are speechless and brute, and bound to die soon.
Yes, there is much to love about the body.
Too, there is much to hate. I cast off care for pleasure,
and for labor, teaching my body over time that these things
can’t coexist. I fear it has started to believe me.
My body has never sought wholeness the way yours did, sister.
It was always still the dull twilight of early morning with us.
You were twenty-four, and when you died, I stopped fearing
arson. When I picture us as girls, we are at the base
of the mountain from my visio, divining the summit
as we diminish into spots of light. We are without parentage.
On my mountaintop in midafternoons flocks of wheeling
birds gather around the crescent moon. When the moon
worms its way through the clouds, it fixes its eyes on me
and sings a song that says we live our lives chained to earth,
and that when we die the flesh falls off our bones
so our bones can turn into the driest of riverbed dirt.
Sister, when you died, your bones cast an enchantment.
We made a powder of them, and I named the powder ash,
because ash is a word with neither origin nor afterlife,
and its definition is the look a doe gets when she’s been away
from her herd too long. When a person goes missing
and we don’t know her name, we grant her the surname Doe.
With this christening we name all missing persons
part of the family of ash, which has no family.
Sometimes I think that each speck of ash
previously named Priya hums on quiet nights
in a frequency only the other pieces can hear.
Inaudible to the waking world she hums to herself.
That hum is how my blood became blue; in lieu of oxygen,
my body began to breathe in only the vibrations of the hum.
Blood has to be born into its colors. Or, more precisely,
it has to die into them. In Hesiod’s Theogony, Nyx is born
of Chaos. Erebus, Gaia, and Tartarus are her siblings.
Hesiod couldn’t decide whether Nyx birthed the Fates
or whether the Fates were born of someone else, but he knew
that Nyx’s children, whoever they were, had no sire.
About Nyx’s brothers and sisters, Hesiod writes:
Earth too, and great Oceanus, and dark Night,
the holy race of all the other deathless ones that are for ever,
and one day — what? Tell me. Tell me the song they taught you.
Tell me how you learned how beautiful Nyx is,
how you realized Zeus feared her, and how you first saw
that within her every star, from the swollen to the hollow,
from the living to the dead, is visible, powered by little
but her peerless face. When I returned north for the first time
since my father turned my sister into a powder named ash,
a word born of nothing and with no children, I heard her
from a seagull on the ferry I rode from the harbor to the Cape,
out of a piping plover on the dunes, in a crow’s call on the highway
from Boston to Gloucester, past Folly’s Cove, Prides Crossing,
Rust Island. Then, from my station again on the mountain,
I heard my own voice from a brown thrasher. That night I drove
through remains of a fresh accident on the mountain highway.
The dropping sun lit my back as if heralding fire.
A dislocated red front bumper straddled the median,
singing a song. Nyx was in the wind, and her siblings,
and they bade me sing, too, like Hesiod had asked.
Grant lovely song, celebrate the holy race of the deathless
gods who are for ever, born of Earth and starry Heaven
and gloomy Night and them that briny Sea did rear.
Soon all were singing. The median sang with the deep voice
of a woman who knows how to sing scat, and the mountain,
standing like a moon on earth, responded with a wordless song
of its own creation. Ash sang. Dirt sang. To them I lent a melody,
which is one of the things I do when I can’t sleep. The secret
about lullabies: when they work, it’s because they sound
like something plants would sing in Hades, on the banks
of the river dark. Oh how I wish they worked on me.
When the sculptor couldn’t sleep, she drew mountains.
They were pink, red, ridged and pulsing, and rose
from valleys of blue. Or else she’d draw eyes that held
too many irises, or wombs that bore sweet cysts,
or spindle-legged women with outsized, drooping breasts,
ill-formed and misshapen eyes for nipples, uneven halos
for areolae, made of the same skin as the kind under eyes
that have been open for too long. Those songs I sing
when I can’t sleep are directed to my army of visios.
In return, they give me images of myself as different
creatures: gibbons, a chicken with a plucked-feather neck,
an asteroid, a mountain, a volcano with the thinnest,
most translucent shell. Me, as some fantastical beast with eyes
lining the inside of my body, watching my diaphragm
turn into the ocean I saw from the ferry, watching plumes of sun
flare over it as it comes to resemble a dead animal’s
long-weathered skin. Ghostly ships with dropped anchors
materialize to trawl it, and squadrons of men dismount,
searching for new blooms in terra mountainous and lush.
My heart is a sky embalmed and bright. When the phantoms
drop anchor, there to welcome their sailors are screaming pelicans
on the rocks, and parades continually wheeling of ugly vultures
in funereal garb. In their eyes, the Atlantic always looks besieged
by hurricane. Lunar maria means moon seas, but when I hear it
I picture horses, torqued female beasts who live on the moon
and whose manes are made of the roots of moon-trees.
I did not want to die, but I wanted to want death.
None of you ever knew how badly. I have practiced at it.
At times I rehearsed like a dancer, surrounded by mirrored walls.
At others I moonlighted with movies set on battlefields
and abattoirs, pausing and rewinding until I could mimic
the motions of actresses who succumb to unexpected poison,
or shove knives into their bellies, or fall like Brueghel’s boy.
I pretended I was standing in a castle dressed like a samurai,
looking through a barred window, knowing the trees
approaching held a promise so annihilative my flesh
would have no choice but to accept. I pictured jumping
from the top of the mountain and I sang Love it Love it Love it.
On my mountain the birds shroud the pines, and the pines
make a spectral outline against the valley of Nyx’s body.
One afternoon here a man said to his son: All this has to do
with eons of time, water over and over, just cutting and cutting
the rock. From where I stand on its summit, I can touch
the Big Dipper and I can see its children, and another peak,
shaped like the back of a horse. It is shadow blue, the same blue
as the dying sky. To the Big Dipper and her children I sing a song
that asks if they are safe, and tells them that on forest floors,
dappled things of glass and light grow from knotted roots.
Sister, could I find you on that horse mountain? I wonder
if I want to. Have I made this world? Lover, a confession.
If I found my sister on any mountain, I would gather her
in my arms and take her from its back, singing lullabies.
Or else I’d take an arrow laced with a drug I’d made special
for her, and, standing close, push it in her unarmed
right flank. Instead of how to die, I ended up studying
how to kill. But the sculptor, she asked nothing of her dead.
Out of visions of them she made formidable metal spiders
she named Maman, Maman, Maman. Maman Maman Maman,
who live after the sculptor has died, have all lost children,
like my mother. Their domains are terrors — land-terrors,
water-terrors, terrors of the open sky. Their hearts are war-
grief. Terrors of trees in the joyless forest, of portent.
Sometimes in their homes are fires on floods, dire wonders.
Their children were all named Doe, which means that the plural
form for children of Maman is deer. For a long time I hated
the phrase I am sorry for your loss. I lost nothing. My sister died.
But loss is less of a euphemism than its users want;
to lose means both to have been defeated and to misplace.
Maman Maman Maman also answers to Demeter Demeter Demeter.
Sister, I could stop no one from taking your head,
although I promise you I fought for it, hand-to-hand
by the mouth of the bone-house. One day on my mountain,
I got to thinking about those other peaks. From a cave
underwater I heard: Find them, like flowers strange
and never before seen. And so it became true.
I found mountains covered in smoke-thick fogs,
and mountains that lied — those were barely hills.
And then I found them: what the mountains in my visio
would have looked like had it been summer in that land.
Summer brought some changes: my body had no orchids
or lichen, and the crown was not of diamonds, but the reek
of sewage, wafting over a field — a prairie almost —
from which rose tens of signal towers, all blinking red.
The base of mountains was, when I got there, still,
and in darkness. It was a sky in which every child of every star,
living or dead, could be heard humming. The peerless
face of the mountain was cragged rock, dust rock, shadow rock.
I stayed until day, to watch the birth of a sunbeam
so I could then see it age. Later in the day an immense heat
came, like another bone-house. I climbed the ridges, which turned
to colored ringlets of cloud and ash at the slightest pressure.
Sunrise and sunset were scant minutes of shadow-play.
The prairie grass’s rustle, each blade sang in a different language.
There I learned the names of four of the lunar mares:
Catfire, Osiris, Blood Oath, and Early Morning.
This is who I am. I harbor secret loves, and I do secret work.
Catfire, Osiris, Blood Oath, and Early Morning are teaching me
how to finally chart a course through time, how to carve
journeys in space: they descended from their moon to the crags,
followed me home to my moonlike mountain. Lover, my body —
you won’t be able to keep up with it. Soon you’ll have to leave it.
You’ll have to leave me. Or else I’ll leave you, because my body,
it invents definitions for the word sadness, like noun, the feathers
on a bird’s back. You’ll do nothing for me. On my mountain,
it’s midafternoon, and the wheeling birds are landing
steadily, even though no stable ground is here to be found.
When they sing, it is a song that I, who know no prayers,
imagine to be gospel. A man comes up the mountainside
and sings along with them as he walks in circles on the rock.
Robbed, sister, was your breath. Robbed, lover, is yours, too.
Sister, I wish you could know this feeling: if sung perfectly,
pressure on each nerve cluster can make bones irrelevant, whether
those bones are living or dead, whether they are ash or dirt.
At the base of my mountain is a lake where creatures go to die.
Water slides into their spiracles and fills their tracheae.
Their tracheae stretch into bellows fit to extinguish the fires
in any volcano. When my body showed me sadness
and began there to outline and diagram the word,
another definition was noun, a chorus of brass instruments,
like upward-turned mouths forged of metal, and another was verb,
to shake like chimes flanking a rock-hewn shore, barely alive
and almost imperceptible for a flash. Sometimes I picture
my sister underneath one of the sculptor’s spiders.
Her head barely reaches the first joint on the spider’s leg,
and when she looks up, she thinks that the whole sky
is the spider’s stomach. Maman, she says, I am hungry.
Food. Food. I am hungry. She runs her shrunken finger
from one tagma to another. Her stroke makes lava run faster
in all the volcanoes within the tectonic plate on which she lives,
and she, unawares, suckles at every ridge she can find.
She rests both palms flat against the metal, closes her eyes
and cries. What would the world look like with enough lava
to fill the Atlantic? I know that the Earth’s temperature
has risen, and I know that all of its ice will melt.
I know there will be no more purple from the sun, that the spider’s
iron underside is one of the few things that, like my mother,
does not sing. At the lake today is a flock of feral cats.
Though they’re in front of me, their song comes from below,
so although I can see them, I picture them swimming in a river
that separates mortals from the planet’s heart. In this river floats
the phantom of a dead doe. Listen to me now, darlings:
my sister did not live long enough to see the moon
turn red, but I did, and despite those who wish otherwise,
myself included, I will see it again. Sadness’s fourth definition
is conjunction, bees, forests of them, devotional and thick enough
to knot together human dreams, or human bodies, even when ghostly,
or lovelorn. The underground river gives me no passage,
despite my dreams of the phantom that dropped anchor
somewhere, and of its amassed pelicans and vultures.
Each ghost is filled to the brim with flowers whose scents
describe the places they were born, just like mine does,
no matter how hard I try to cloak it. On the top of my mountain
a man says to a woman: I like how there’s just trees. Trees trees trees,
she replies. Each time she says the word, her voice makes
a new species. I recently tried another way to die: could I fall
from a tower filled wall-to-wall with twenty-four thousand
living flowers, each planted in the soil covering the tower’s floors,
six inches deep? The flowers would have heavy-branched
spikes for blooms, and would release a powerful smell
of bone marrow, and spew a pollen that fills the air until
it becomes oppressive. When I opened my mouth to sing
of this, instead of a sound my mouth expelled gnats and fog,
which is what a spider’s milk is made of. The word Nyx
tastes like sister and means both night and flower. I worry
I won’t rest again. Do you know how a naked Titan looks,
sister? He’s swarmed with shadow, but he holds light deep
in his stomach, like an electric secret. Dear love,
I can’t give you what you need from me. All I’ll do is take.
After my sister died, I learned she always wanted a warm island,
garlands draped around her neck. There was no mountain
in her vision. Instead, in it she was singing what she imagined
was an island song in a language I don’t know. She was dancing
badly, and breathing with great labor on burnished sands.
Sand bores me, sister; I need rock and high altitude.
When I am cold, I hear wolves. I think they live in the carillon
beside the mountain’s lake. Sister, it was always true
that I would outlive you. I know exactly how many times
my family wished me dead. Don’t look up, says a child
on the top of my mountain. It makes you want to fall.
It will always be still the dull twilight of early morning with us.
This is one of the curses of living. In the end, my visio alone
will sing and dance, breathing heavily. Every day the sunbeams
in it turn a brighter pink. Dears. Beloveds. All of you.
Your blood is bewitched, and bade to move into places
it wasn’t meant to go, steeped deeply in poisons
it can’t purge. You share the look on your face
with all the others, whether deer, child, or man.
If you look deeply enough into any other pair of eyes,
your heart valves start to change allegiances. Your body’s lakes
fill with the other’s want, until all you want, in turn,
is what the other wants, which rises in you like seawater.
There are species of flowers and invasive weeds that live only
in another’s gaze, whether lovelorn, hate-filled, hopeless,
or hungry. I am looking into your eyes right now,
and in my mind are two girl deer. Sisters. With thin-hooved
legs steady, digging into grass. They disappear into the woods,
which are part of a forest in a painting. When the novelist
saw this painting, he thought that there he could see men
turning into birds and birds turning into men,
and those same men turning then into sea creatures,
and then back into birds. From this final change
scales and tentacles would linger on their backs
as they wheeled through the air, as would the dream
of filling their lungs with the sea, for which they would ache.
The definition of deer is lost. The definition of beloved
is dissolution. On the top of my mountain I hear a mother
call to a faceless child, Where are you? The chattering
and thin voice of a boy from the top of a tree cries back,
In the woods. And then, beguilingly: Come into the woods.
Around the orbs of light in the forest that I still don’t know
if the Dipper’s children can see, new trees grow beside the pines:
elms, birches, willows, one strange Western juniper.
Each creature in this forest was once something, or someone, else —
the novelist was right. The top of one of the elms
is a sprig of radiant blood. Sister, I was very young
when I found out you were cloven-hooved. I did what I could.
I want to say that you can trust me, that I am listening to you,
and that you can speak to me and that I will speak to you
at last. Tell me about the beasts that got you. The beasts
who carry me when I am too weak to carry my deer alone
are Catfire, Osiris, Blood Oath, and Early Morning.
I would like to believe that I carry this deer for you,
that I’ll be able to tell you what it feels like to have
a hungry mouth on your lip or nipple. I want to say:
Sister, I promise. But the definition of myth is noun,
the idea that any one creature can ever hear another.
And while I beguile you to betray yourself to me,
like lovers do in their sleep, I am lying to you. No, death
did not bring this to us. It has always been true. I, sister,
am a selfish woman, and you, sister, were a mute one.
My body invents words and swells with prophecies.
Its effort shows in insect bites and rashes that don’t heal,
in my peeled hands, bleeding groin, wistful gut, misaligned jaw,
mole-like left eye, lump-riddled womb. Dears. Beloveds.
You’ve been asleep a long time, but we all return
to the waking world someday. And when you do at last
come back, you will find me spent and alone, ugly,
wounded, ungrateful, ill. Shaking and calling to you for aid.
Loveless. Without a soul or even the memory of pleasure.
The last lover to desert me will deem me rancid.
The last thing I hear my sister’s voice from will be dirt.
Of the mares I will have left only Early Morning,
who won’t know that I will soon take her hide,
turn it into an ocean that will, at last, cleave open my skull.

I found Rome in the woods. Fair to admit it’s mostly tundra to the west in the park, past Toklat the Denali I revised, low grasslands engineered to freeze deep by October — this being Alaska — the great             Tabularium close to the Temple of             Castor and Pollux I rebuilt that same summer —              not superimposed, exact as any scheme in secret — the Arch of Septimius Severus at the gravel bar         where fox drank from a river turned stream,            a Theater of Marcellus near                the ranger station where one raven,                                                                                     such a brat,    complained of                       my Circus Maximus, Trajan’s Column,                               my Baths of Diocletian, too many spots soaked in unpronounceable Latin.                     I really did, I shouldered bits of it,       a ruin-hushed haunted business, my brain                                                          a truck bed, a lift, pulleys big as a whale’s heart, expletives of cheap wonder all over                                                                   my woodlot and expanse.                           One self-anoints to embellish day, years, life thus far, and think oneself so ...                            Then busted —  by a raven! Well, that’s memory for you, that’s so-called         civilization for you, to layer up,                          to redo the already done. I mean it’s a fact, the puny life span we’re allotted.               And proof — Denali in August, fireweed, spunky scrawny first Latinate — Erechtites hieracifolia —                 giving off flowers to mark                what weeks left, little                time bomber, time traveler, ancient                slips red-flagging the countdown to winter                by climbing its own stalk. Something perverse about that. Something perfectly fiendishly self-conscious about that.    •  From the start perverse, any premise.       Ask ... We can’t know. To be compelled             makes an occasion. Rome’s grand      past horrific, fire and ash, swamp into bog, lust               and bloodlust —  The Alaska Range dreams lurid as Rome,                                         the worst way below being fire, summer snow at night       off the highest peaks by noon               as distant from our cabin as the size of a hand if I                          held up the one with                          an eye in the middle to know how this works. Some have the power to raise from the dead a before, before scary and beautiful            back to mystery cults, in caves, rubble far under a Roman street, the altar to Mithras still slaying his bull, crumbling the stonework.             All things being equal. But they’re not.                     Agony, it’s older.                       Ask the moose at Denali,                          the snowshoe hare, the lynx, such a wily courtly lot.                                            Ask Ovid       banished to his hovel on the Black Sea, aching                 for Rome’s exalted rude cacophony, each       exiled month a big thick X down                                   Februarius,                                 Aprilis to home-shattered sick enough for an undersong. Look it up! Undersong: a strain; a droning; the burden of a song —                                               Maybe that lowest common denominator is contagious. Rome or Denali, a mash-up of lunge and cry out, predator and prey throwing coins to a fountain, footholds made first by a hoof, pickpockets at buses and trains, nuns queuing up their no-nonsense, thorny brambles, raggedy spruce groves,                                            a look, a nod to sell loveless love on the street, a chain of mountains in choral repeat, saints stained to glass, how ice gouged rivers from rock-bound,                                  the one-lung rapturous common-sense Pope all outstretched arms, his little popemobile circling the thrilled at St. Peter’s up on our rickety chairs to see in six, seven languages how radiant —                              Cross my heart, he was. And Keats, Keats is coughing.   •  You find the fossil record everywhere. In woods, tundra, under streets, in cadaver labs.                                  Not those bright transparencies, wistful orderly page after page in biology, a lie, a kind of flip-book romance. It’s the one big mess of us in us, the generous extraordinary dead prove that, signing a paper, giving themselves away                                             to be cut, disembodied for the knowing it, sunk to their chemical depth in some afterlife, opened on a table by kids really,                                              belabored doctors-to-be, our shabby shared wilderness to untangle, bones   joints   arteries   valves,                                                         The Dissector in hand, weirdest how-to book on the planet. For Keats too, 1819, his scribbled roses and sunflowers in margins,                                                                   his training,                                                            his anatomy theatre, looking down and later: still London, then Rome (he who gets it,   body fails, second floor, beside the Spanish Steps).                                            Heart, not my heart anymore.                                      Forgive me. I’m worse than the hopelessly confused misnamed English sparrow, descendant of the great weaver birds of Africa, a finch that lost the gene        for nest, how to beneath, to across so intricate, precise, bringing bringing sticks and hair and bits of shiny paper. Undersong: the burden of a song.                                                        Poor bird. Poor sweet muddled middle of it. I watched morning after morning, his offering ...                                                                            It’s Keats who made claims about beauty and time. His bed at the last                         too low for the window, his must-have                                 tell me, what’s out there —  I admit: a ridiculous layering, Rome in Denali. Just because? Because I went to both in short order? Two continents, an ocean apart. My mother loved hand-me-down expressions —never the twain shall meet. They do meet.                            To repeat: that’s civilization for you. Happenstance and right now drag along future and past                              and why the hell not the Denali, the Rome in any of us, no two states of being more unalike, worn-out compulsion to collect and harbor, piece together,                                                                    stupid into some remember machine.    Such fabulous unthinkable inventions we’ve made to merge or unmake: the trash compactor,    the poem, all tragedy and story, pencils sharpened to a point that keeps breaking, wilderness gone inward as                    an ocean-going ship’s container,                          a Gatling gun,                                  the AR-15 of the seething deranged,                                          the H-bomb,                                              Roman legions to Canterbury to blood-up fields into legend then dig the first plumbing but                                             how can you                                             be in two places at once                                             when you’re not anywhere at all!         (Thank you, Firesign Theatre, brilliant wackos,               old vinyl on a turntable still in the game ... )                       Fine. Fuck it. Start over.   •  See the sheep on high ledges, the arctic squirrels below. See the way Dante saw, sweeping his arm across Vasari’s great painting as Boccaccio looks off, the plague sealing city after city. Dante in hell, steady-luminous      those fact-finding trips to service            his worldly Inferno. Winter sleeps through. August at Denali, bears shovel it down        a razor-edged maw —                                                  twigs! berries! more stems! —  Fate hoards to prepare, sub-zeros, fattens into ....     See the park’s camper bus, 92 miles how most of us jolt and slow, crossing hours more daylight than night all summer, rattling tin can with its exhaust and hissing gravel, the fearlandslide                   an undersong just-possible, how we zigzag a mountain. Look!                   Nearing a bear, the young caribou abruptly                              hesitant, shy as a leaf — No! Don’t! Do not! That grizzly huge, bent to his ploy just                                                  these berries around here, his ignore ignore, sure, quiet-tense as a trigger, and we of                       fogged scratched windows so hard to open —  stop! The bus stopped. Jesus.

Such fabulous unthinkable inventions we’ve made

both shackled to a grindstone for
a later mob and roar.

Here’s what we saw: the little caribou
in reverse wanders sideways and safe.
Our bus one big sigh or
like a wheezing asthmatic
the brakes unbrake.

Bad dream, bad dream, the undersong start to all fable if
for real we’d seen that kill
back to lions off their continent
cornered, bloodied in the great amphitheaters, rearing up,
a nail to hammer’s
bite and blow. The wilderness in us

is endless. Near the cabin, near evening, a warbler
in the fireweed
hawk saw or heard,
his switchblade clicked to —
I was and I was
whirling feathers, either bird —
Every hunger
is first century. Forever-thus
feral cats at the Forum about to leap too.
The Forum, last homage
I shoveled holes and rocks to
remake, mile 82, while the haymouse riddled the meadow
down deep, her catacombs.
•
•
Time + beauty = ruins. Perfect shapes in the mind
meet my friends Pointless and Threat and Years of
Failure to Meld or Put to Rest. Ruthless
is human.

I ask a composer: How to live with this undersong thing
over and over, how to
get rid of it,
the world of it —

He looks at me. What undersong thing? And shrugs
I’ll put it on the test! Let students define it.

So I dreamt such a test: Go there. To Rome.
Half-doze against a wall
two thousand years of

flesh    sweat    insect wing ago, stone laid by hand, by
a boy when a whip, a whip, a welling up, his will not speak.

Have at it. Please explain. Please fill in this blank.

Grief punctures like ice, moves like a glacier
to flat and slog and myth, low blue and white flowers
we hiked trail-less. The rangers insist. They insist —

never follow or lead, never lay down a path.

From above
the look of us spread out, our seven or eight
a band, little
stray exhausted figures
as over the land bridge from Asia,

circa: prehistory keeps coming, older than Rome,
both   both underfoot, understory, underway

miles below numb, it’s burning.
•
•
To see at all, you time
and this time and time again.

The spirit leans
intrigued, the other part bored, then there’s want,
then there’s wait.

Once a city began with a wolf whose two human pups would
build, would watch it fall, nursing
at her milk for centuries
in marble
in bronze.

She stands there and cries of
that pleasure, by turns
a blood-chill. The tundra. At night.

A snake eats its own tail, forever at it on a fresco.
A real snake
leaves his skin near the gravel bar. Some words
sting, some are sung. Another life
isn’t smaller.

Two bulls stand on a hill. The younger says,

No son, let’s strut down and fuck them all.

Thus begins the beef  between bird and bee,

My marbles stay

Sometimes I feel so Socratic: oft-laureled, poison-palmed,

Free-spirited, you don’t say.

that
Oh my god Becky, look at her butt

I have eaten from the tree the fig that sullies and seen
that the meat’s not always

fair.
I was,
like Perseus
and Sir Mix-a-Lot,
born by a riv
of water,

felled by pride when
a brown boy, tattooed with age,

obsessed with fame, took his talents
to Vermont to kiss trees and tap
syrup from the sap.
There and there
and there, he kissed. Here and here
he drank.
So drunk he hugged an old
white woman
off the ground. None of the gods
I love

Don’t bother the earth spirit who lives here. She is working on a story. It is the oldest story in the world and it is delicate, changing. If she sees you watching she will invite you in for coffee, give you warm bread, and you will be obligated to stay and listen. But this is no ordinary story. You will have to endure earthquakes, lightning, the deaths of all those you love, the most blinding beauty. It’s a story so compelling you may never want to leave; this is how she traps you. See that stone finger over there? That is the only one who ever escaped.

If she sees you watching she will invite you in for coffee, give you warm bread, and you will be obligated to stay and listen. But this is no ordinary story. You will have to endure earthquakes, lightning, the deaths of all those you love, the most blinding beauty. It’s a story so compelling you may never want to leave; this is how she traps you. See that stone finger over there? That is the only one who ever escaped.
